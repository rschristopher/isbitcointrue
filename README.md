# Is Bitcoin True?

## TODO
+ Estimate time
    - 72 essays, at least (likely more)
    - minimum 2-3 days each
    - minimum 3-5 days each for research and testing
    - 216 days of work, or ~700 hours
        - this is equivalent to acquiring fluency in French


## In the year 2140
Full Bitcoin Standard.
Market cap of money, $300T, $14.285M BTCUSD

1 sat ~= 0.1428 USD

1 USD ~= 7 sats


TXN fee average, 1000 sats
$1,428 per txn

3000 txns per block
$4.28M block reward

$1,428 is then roughly the cost to go 
 from 2nd layer savings to sovereign individual.
In other words, to secure your savings
 outside any custodian, to provide your own
 liquidity for 2nd layer savings and payments,
 to free oneself from whichever provider
 one was working for.
As a sovereign individual, one is free to hire
 their own team, investing in their own
 infrastructure.
They either profit, sustain, or go bankrupt.
Competition amongst sovereign individuals
 is zero sum on the base layer, but positive
 sum in local environments as economies grow
 and new sovereign individuals are created.

Fast forward... The value of the Bitcoin Standard
 increases by 7x

$100M BTCUSD
1 sat = 1 USD

$10,000 per txn, the cost of 
 becoming a sovereign individual is 7x harder.
This benefits families and multigenerational
 wealth strategies while not precluding
 individuals from joining the ranks
 of financial sovereignty.

Each block is worth $30M, network security
 is at an ATH.

157.68M blocks per year

This roughly equates to 10s of millions of
 financial sovereigns, out of billions of
 people.
Most will not be a sovereign.
Families and dynasties will be sovereign.

Let's imagine 12-billion global population,
 and only 90-million sovereigns.
This is an average population of 133 persons
 per sovereign.
Under a Pareto distribution, we can expect
 80% of the population in the top 20%
 of sovereigns, that is,
 9.6B people in 18M sovereigns,
 averaging ~533 people per.
The largest sovereigns might have thousands
 of people, some with tens of thousands.
But due to the nature of the game, it's
 unlikely a given sovereign would grow too
 large (before disintegrating into smaller units).
And people would be free to go from one
 sovereign to another.
They all need workers and people,
 they're always hiring (otherwise why waste the
 money on even being a sovereign).

In any reasonable analysis,
 this is is far more scalable than the ~200 or
 so sovereign nation states
 (with <20 that actually matter)
 acting as totalitarian
 regimes and slave labor coordinators for
 billions of people.
A Bitcoin standard is the end of a global
 oligarchy, much like modernity was the
 end of nepotistic monarchies.
