...
theory, even early on adoption, prices in Bitcoin represent a more accurate signal than feet.
If this is true, then one should be able to create an investment strategy based on comparative prices in Bitcoin over time -- such that:
+ X vs Y, priced in Bitcoin should be stable, but if X > Y, then Y is underpriced and one ought to buy Y as an arbitrage.

this strategy requires assets that should be stable over time relative to one another, and differ only due to cantillion effects such that the Bitcoin price acts as a signal for an upcoming correction.

this can include index funds, cars, classic artwork, gold, housing, and really anything with a functioning market.

track prices over time for:
+ spi
+ median family home
+ most popular car
+ McDonald's cheeseburger
+ barrel of oil
etc


when to buy:
all prices in Bitcoin, look for stability and create indexes to discover arbitrage opportunities, e.g., oil price (in Bitcoin) drops, while the others do not, buy oil company stock..

note: this is different than relative value changes, because we're looking only for cases where the price in Bitcoin drops but only for one of the assets, that is,
+ it's not just a sudden drop in BTCUSD
+ it's not just a decrease of one asset to another (oil getting cheaper relative to spi - in this case oil would have to get cheaper relative to the other assets AND its price in Bitcoin must go down)

when to sell:
when the price of X (in Bitcoin) falls back in line with the other assets.
Again, Bitcoin is merely acting as the cleaner price signal, revealing arbitrages in the fiat system.
