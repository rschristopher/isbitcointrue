    - minimum 2-3 days each
    - minimum 3-5 days each for research and testing
    - 216 days of work, or ~700 hours

Self custody is a misnomer,
 a dangerous one.
The only important topic is access to your wealth.
It's either your wealth or it's not.
If you're trusting a friend or business with
 your keys then it's the same as trusting them
 with your passwords.

Dangerously, we are conflating access to wealth
 with custody of assets.
The distributed ledger
 (the timechain or blockchain)
 is the custodian.
How do you access this?
You do so through keys.
If you have someone managing your keys,
 then you end up with a password,
 another form of key,
 to access your keys.
Bitcoin custodians, any kind of
 hosted wallet,
 is effectively an unnecessary middleman.
You don't have a service that manages
 your house keys, you maintain access
 to your house, because it's your house.
Same with your car.
No one imagines we need a custodian
 for our car keys.
Key management is and always has been
 the responsibility of the owner
 of said asset.

Self custody => key management, access to your wealth

Self sovereignty => sovereignty
