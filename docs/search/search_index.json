Bitcoin -- if it is true -- fixes all of the problems of fiat money, even modern art. The problem of fiat money \u00b6 Bitcoin was designed to fix the problem of fiat money, which is the problem of politics and money, an incessant problem that has burdened human civilization throughout history. You may have gotten into Bitcoin as an investment; a high-risk and volatile investment; an investment into the best performing asset of all time. And yet, Bitcoin was not designed to be an investment. Bitcoin was designed to be money, sound money that can fix the problems of fiat money -- it is in this regard that we ask: is Bitcoin true? The problems of fiat money run deep, beyond the ever-increasing price of meat and potatoes -- shaping Politics and War, Food and Health, Education and Research, Science and Innovation -- and yes, even modern art . Even modern art? \u00b6 modern art under fiat This is an actual piece of art -- that sold . There are many such examples, along with eye-roll inducing apologetics, such that the banana represents a critique of the very problems of modern art that everyone is criticizing. Janitors protested the banana for pay inequality, another artist ate the banana, and still another wrote \"Epstein didn't kill himself\" on the wall in red lipstick. Even the artists and the art dealers know that modern art is vapid nonsense, and so they perform self-referential pieces of art, criticising themselves, being cynical about cynicism -- someone will then call the self-referential cynicism \"genius\" -- and why stop if the money keeps rolling in? Rather than ask what is and what is not art, instead ask how art collectors have money for this kind of art, and why they see value in it. And most importantly, find out where that money came from. Where does money come from? \u00b6 Money operates as a measure of value, subjective value based on the perceptions of those buying and selling. Money also stores value, value to be used in the future. The time between earning money and spending money is known as \"saving\". This simple and subjective sense of value is all that money is and ever will be. It is best understood as a technology, such that good money will be more efficient than bad money. It can be strong money with a fixed supply, or it can be easy money with an inflationary supply. Inflationary money disprupts the natural cycle of saving, replacing the age old \"saving for the future\" with consumerism, with credit and debt, with a system of constant spending -- because money that constantly loses value is simply worth more now than it will be in the future. Worse, fiat money is inflationary at the whims of those who control the money supply. There is a reason janitors have less purchasing power than ever before. And it's not because a wealthy person controlled this outcome. If you are a janitor earning fiat money, you will work harder and harder, but you will earn less and less value over time . And that amount of lost value will be gained by those known as cantilion insiders, those close to the money supply, those who benefit from increases in the money supply, including art collectors. An art collector's salary will also lose value over time, just like the janitor. However, assets such as real-estate and art will increase in value. Inflating the money supply doesn't just drive up prices of consumer goods, it first inflates the value of hard assets, transfering wealth from those who work and save, to those who own hard assets. And if you dig deep enough, you'll find that most art collectors don't actually earn a salary, have never earned a salary, and that their wealth is not stored in cash. Political solultions make the problem worse, and over time those controlling the money supply use their ill-gotten gains (known as seigniorage ) to control the politics (regardless of the system), so it inevitably becomes a rigged game (be it a democracy or theocracy or socialist dictatorship or otherwise). Revolutions change the faces of the problem, but like the word implies, a revolution is to move in a circle. There is no political solution. If you ever wonder why seemingly diverse modern societies are struggling with consumerism, environmental catastrophes, health epidemics where supposedly \"wealthy\" populations are malnourished and dying younger, and fighting endless wars over control of oil -- look no further than the source of all this misery -- fiat money, where unaccountable bureaucrats control the supply of money at the expense of civilization itself. While the current round of non-sustainable monetary parasitism began in 1971 , this problem is as old as time. Whether it's causal or not can be debated, but societies fall when their money is debased (just ask the Romans). No reasonable person can believe otherwise. The real question becomes, what can be done about the problem of fiat money? The terrifying truth \u00b6 If Bitcoin is true, it is almost too terrifying to contemplate. Bitcoin simply could not succeed in an honest system. It is merely a set of protocols around a cryptographic ledger designed to prevent any and all centralized control of money; it requires voluntary participation; it is designed such that no one can or will control the monetary policy . As a consequence of its design, it is slow and less efficient than what a non-corrupt centralized system could achieve. It is only superior to corrupt dishonest systems (because it fixes the bad-actor problem). If Bitcoin is true it would mean that the problems of fiat money are not only real but irreconciliable. It would mean our entire system is built on lies, and that our leaders are parasitic sociopaths, selected by broken incentives that benefit short-term gains at the expense of the future, unknowingly destroying civilization in the process. And it means that we are participants in this lie. For Americans it means Nixon was worse than liberals believe, and that FDR was even worse than Nixon. It means our media is corrupt propaganda, and that our political parties are nothing but the coordinators of this propaganda. And none of this is by design but is a consequence of the fiat system itself; of the broken incentives that reward short-term gains at the expense of civilization. Such a system will discourage you from ever discovering, where does money come from? This is a lot to take in for even a cynical person. You've been lied to about money, by people who aren't particularly competent, told that money doesn't grow on trees and then to look the other way when money is created from nothing; all by the whims of parasitic sociopaths that know not what they do. It's tempting to believe the lies, either that they don't exist (it's all just a conspiracy theory) or to believe they exist and are competent enough to actually control money. But the terrifying truth is that they do exist, but are completely incompetent. They don't understand that one cannot actually control money. No one can control money , because money relies on the ever-changing perspectives of value of every person on earth. Money is technology Money is the technology that allows for the ever-changing perspectives of value (of every human on earth) to be made known and measurable, that is, to have what are known as prices and markets . Money requires freedom, freedom to change your mind on a whim, to change your perception of value based on the ever-changing demands in your life. One cannot control money without controlling the subjective values of every person on earth, controlling not just their thoughts, but their innate sense of value, and all the externalities that might cause them to react, rendering them less than cattle, less than rats, something more akin to cogs in a machine, a machine that is controlled by -- who exactly? \"Bitcoin fixes this\" \u00b6 This oft-repeated quote struck me as too good to be true, the wishful thinking of youthful idealists who are all theory with no real-world experience, those unprepared for the chaotic realpolitik of life. And yet, if what is claimed about Bitcoin is true, then it could fix the damaging effects of inflationary money. If the supply is truly scarce, now and in the future; and if the network is truly decentralized, such that no system of authority can control or kill it, then yes, logically, Bitcoin could fix many of the problems of fiat money. But like I said, that all seems too good to be true. Like trying to contemplate what life would be like if people were always honest and forthright; if everyone was kind, humble, and forgiving. People aren't always that way, and it's not helpful to pretend otherwise. And yet, Bitcoin assumes the opposite, that no one can be trusted. don't trust, verify The entire design of Bitcoin is a trustless system that assumes no one is honest. No one. You must verify everything. If there's something we can't verify, then trust is required, in which case we're back to fiat, back to the very problem that Bitcoin is trying to solve. For Bitcoin to be true, everything must be verifiable. Why not other Cryptocurrencies? \u00b6 Altcoins are not attempting to solve the problem Bitcoin solves. They offer no scarcity, and no true decentralization. Most are free market monies that operate as securities. They sometimes offer interesting features because they're digital money, but without scarcity over time. Most are merely copies of Bitcoin but with a centralized source of control, completely defeating the point, which is why you will hear them referred to as \"shitcoins\". Shitcoins cannot solve the problem of fiat money. And they don't try. In all cases they are attempting to become fiat money, granting seigniorage to their own founders. Bitcoin is in a category all its own, a scarce digital resource, a superior money. If Bitcoin is true, then it wins in the end, outcompeting all other money, potentially redeeming civilization in the process. Anything less than that would prove Bitcoin false. What if Bitcoin is false? \u00b6 What if in our journey to verify everything we miss something? And years later we realize that there was a flaw, something we didn't see, but it becomes obvious once exploited. That's all it would take to prove Bitcoin false -- one small counterexample, a flaw that could not be fixed in a soft fork. If trust was required, then that trust could be exploited -- and those who most effectively violate that trust would become the de-facto controllers of Bitcoin, making it no better than fiat. What then? Nothing will have been fixed. The unsustainable problems of fiat would continue in crisis after crisis. However, having learned about Bitcoin you'll understand money. The chaos of the moderm world will make sense. And you'll realize we needed Bitcoin to be true because there was no alternative. Whether we like it or not, the survival of our civilization depends on overcoming the problem of fiat money. This is the challenge of our generation. The existential threats facing our civilization all point back to fiat money. We cannot solve environmental crises, health crises, meaning crises, or any of the problems in education or politics, not without fixing the broken incentives that created those problems to begin with. Bitcoin has been referred to as energy money , one of the great filters to the advancement of civilization. This is a polite way of saying that civilization cannot advance when parasitic bureaucrats play God through vain attempts at controlling money. But this also means, for Bitcoin to be true, it must succeed as energy money ; it must be the catalyst to advance our civilization. All Bitcoin would have to do is work. Every day that it works is another day that it has not been proven false. We can dare to hope; we can look for criticisms ; or we can support Bitcoin's ascent as a true form of energy money that redeems civilization. The stakes are higher than we can imagine, and what happens next, for better or worse, is up to us.","title":"Is Bitcoin True?"},{"location":"is-bitcoin-true/#is-bitcoin-true","text":"One of my earliest reactions to a deep dive into Bitcoin, was the thought, Bitcoin fixes modern art?!

It must be a de-facto superior money to USD, as well as to all fiat money. It must be so superior that it's ascent is only a matter of when and not if -- this is the only way Bitcoin could be considered true . Global Money \u00b6 Money is the technology that makes known the ever-changing perspectives of value of every human being on earth. Additionally, money must store value over time, and it must be transmittable over large distances, anywhere that humans wish to transact. There has never been a true global money , that is, a money that everyone on earth agrees on as their unit of account , their medium of exchange , and as their store of value . Such a technology has never existed, least of all because such a global money must be properly decentralized and uncensorable. Importantly, anyone who controls monetary technology would have power over everyone else wishing to transact with that money. A global money could only be possible if no one controlled it. As such, Bitcoin can only be true if no one can control or limit who can use it. This means attempts to ban it must fail, as well as attempts to subvert or control its monetary policy. Gold and Silver \u00b6 The closest to a global money was gold and silver. One could travel with gold, and use it in most places, provided it was not seized or stolen. Kingdoms and empires fell, but if their coins were in gold, the monetary value of that gold was preserved and spendable elsewhere. Wars were fought over gold, and if you managed to hold onto your gold, not a paper note but the gold itself, that gold would hold its value over time. For example, under the gold standard $20-USD was roughly an ounce of gold. An unskilled worker might earn only 25-cents per hour -- a mere $40 per month -- 2-ounces of gold per month. At today's gold price this is well over $20/hour. Gold-backed money provided a living wage to even the lowest paid workers. Unfortunately, gold cannot be transmitted quickly nor cheaply over large distances. This limitation gives rise to an inevitable system of credit, and then to promisory notes which then lead to fractional reserve, and stey-by-step to pure fiat; money that is backed by-- what exactly? Petrodollar \u00b6 Today, the world operates on a quasi-global currency known as the USD, or more aptly, the petrodollar . It began after 1971 , after a sovereign debt default which ended what was left of the gold standard. For all its faults, the petrodollar system is why you can freely exchange your USD to Canadian dollars or Euros or Yen or Yuan. Almost anywhere on earth you go, you can probably find an ATM that will allow you to withdraw the local currency (at a relatively stable exchange rate). Despite the many problems of fiat money, this technology was itself revolutionary, allowing decades of economic growth on a global scale. The dirty secret was that this economic growth hid the seigniorage of central bankers that has inadvertantly bankrupted every country on earth, strip mined capital , transformed stockpiles of wealth into an unsustainable mountain of debt that can never be paid back (it is money backed by debt afterall). And of course, the not so secret secret, this system requires continuous war over oil. The petrodollar system depends on two critical elements, US military dominance US relations with Saudi Arabia In other words, if Saudi Arabia should fall, the USD petrodollar would collapse overnight. Similarly, if the US military was not the de-facto dominant power on earth, then the USD would collapse (hyperinflating against stronger money). Likewise, if the US government was to collapse, so too would the USD petrodollar system. This bizarre web of dependencies is what it means today to be the global reserve currency . Unlike gold and silver, the petrodollar depends entirely on the US government, the US Treasury, the Federal Reserve, the US military, the Saudi government, and a stable relationship between the US and the Saudis. Fiat Interregnum \u00b6 The design of Bitcoin is to solve the problems of fiat money. As such, if Bitcoin is true then it will inevitably become the money of international settlement, ending the era of fiat money. Bitcoin need not be adopted nor even accepted by the fiat bureaucrats; the truth of Bitcoin is not determined by fiat. For Bitcoin to be true, it need only to work. International settlements must work using Bitcoin. And doing so will reveal the impotence of the parasitic bureaucrats that imagine themselves as in control. Bitcoin is true because it works, and the consequences of that may not be agreeable to most (least of all to the beneficiaries of the fiat system itself). The fiat system produces bureaucratic cruft, delusions of power that arise from the noise of the system, obscuring price signals and creating a class of professional bureaucrats whose job it is to pretend to control money. Bitcoin doesn't make them obsolete, it proves they have been impotent all along, like court astrologers. Under the gold standard, it wasn't the king that gave value to money, it was the gold. The monetary value of gold was all that mattered. Similarly, under a Bitcoin standard, Bitcoin is all that will matter, not its adoption by bureaucrats. In the long arch of history, the modern fiat system is a mere blip as we transition from gold to true global money. This blip of modern fiat was birthed in 1971 although didn't really prove itself till a few years later. By the 1980s it was ostensibly working, and it was uncontested until 2009, until Bitcoin. And in a sly roundabout way, Bitcoin has risen into prominence as an open source global money, poised to supplant the USD petrodollar. And with every decade of it working, it inches closer to becoming the money of international settlements, the base layer behind all money.","title":"Bitcoin as Money"},{"location":"bitcoin-as-money/#bitcoin-as-money","text":"\u201cI don\u2019t believe we shall ever have a good money again before we take the thing out of the hands of government, that is, we can\u2019t take them violently out of the hands of government, all we can do is by some sly roundabout way introduce something they can\u2019t stop.\u201d ~ Friedrich Hayek If Bitcoin is true, it must be Hayek's \"something\" that government can't stop.

International settlements must work using Bitcoin. And doing so will reveal the impotence of the parasitic bureaucrats that imagine themselves as in control. Bitcoin is true because it works, and the consequences of that may not be agreeable to most (least of all to the beneficiaries of the fiat system itself). The fiat system produces bureaucratic cruft, delusions of power that arise from the noise of the system, obscuring price signals and creating a class of professional bureaucrats whose job it is to pretend to control money. Bitcoin doesn't make them obsolete, it proves they have been impotent all along, like court astrologers. Under the gold standard, it wasn't the king that gave value to money, it was the gold. The monetary value of gold was all that mattered. Similarly, under a Bitcoin standard, Bitcoin is all that will matter, not its adoption by bureaucrats. In the long arch of history, the modern fiat system is a mere blip as we transition from gold to true global money. This blip of modern fiat was birthed in 1971 although didn't really prove itself till a few years later. By the 1980s it was ostensibly working, and it was uncontested until 2009, until Bitcoin. And in a sly roundabout way, Bitcoin has risen into prominence as an open source global money, poised to supplant the USD petrodollar. And with every decade of it working, it inches closer to becoming the money of international settlements, the base layer behind all money.","title":"Fiat Interregnum"},{"location":"bitcoin-as-money/fixed-supply/","text":"Fixed Supply \u00b6 Let's consider this classic chart that you may have seen in various corners of the Internet. I've seen many versions of this chart, and always felt there was a lot overlooked. Yes, it's a textbook example of fiat currency hyperinflation, but let's dig a little deeper. We can find the raw Weimar Inflation Data online, and using this we can plot the classic hyperbolic price of gold shown above. Additionally, we can track things like the all time high (ATH) and changes to that ATH. We can scale this out to get a better look at the volatility in the gold price over time. For example, This gives us two distinct stories. We know the story of the gold price . Inflationary paper money will inevitably end this way. However, the volatility is an often overlooked story. There was extreme volatility in the price of gold, as well as in real estate and other hard assets. For well over a year the price was dropping, crashing to less than 50% of its ATH. And then every time there was a new ATH, it was followed for months on end of a painful bear market. And then the process would repeat. The frequency of these painful cycles increased, as did the volatility. The people of Germany in 1921 lacked the benefit of hindsight that we have looking at this classic story of a currency collapse. Instead, they lived through massive uncertainty, holding gold through periods where it seemed to be losing value. And then other periods where the number would go up and up, only to crash once again -- until finally, the mark itself crashed, hyperinflated into oblivion. A fixed supply is not only important, but critical. And as all fiat currencies have demonstrated, inflation is impossible to avoid. In the early days it can be tamed and even reduced, but eventually it grows along with all the consequent problems of fiat money. Is a Fixed Supply Feasible? \u00b6 A fixed supply is not possible through wishful thinking nor central planning. These attempts have all failed, and continue to fail. Gold and silver were more successful as money than other metals simply because their supply was more limited. And yet, the inflation rate of gold (the increase in supply) has historically hovered around 2%. That means every year there is 2% more gold than the previous year. A gold standard means 2% annual inflation. At present, Bitcoin's inflation rate is equal to gold, and after the next halving (likely in May 2024), Bitcoin will become the least inflationary monetary asset the world has ever known. How is it Possible? \u00b6 Many Bitcoiners will tell you to read the code . And yes, the code at the moment will fix the supply at 21 million. GetBlockSubsidy Every 210,000 blocks (roughly every 4 years) the block subsidy (new Bitcoin mined) is reduced in half, and it started at 50. You can calculate 50 times 210,000 to arrive at 10.5 million, exactly half of 21 million. Afterwards, the block subsidy was \"halved\" to 25. Then to 12.5, and we are now in the era of a 6.25 block subsidy. This \"halving\" process will contiue until the year 2140 when the final fraction of a Bitcoin is mined, at which point mining will operate only on transaction fees. CAmount GetBlockSubsidy ( int nHeight , const Consensus :: Params & consensusParams ) { int halvings = nHeight / consensusParams . nSubsidyHalvingInterval ; // Force block reward to zero when right shift is undefined. if ( halvings >= 64 ) return 0 ; CAmount nSubsidy = 50 * COIN ; // Subsidy is cut in half every 210,000 blocks which will occur approximately every 4 years. nSubsidy >>= halvings ; return nSubsidy ; } The >>= operator in the code is a bit shift right, which has the effect of halving a number, e.g., 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.125, 1.5625, ... But this doesn't answer the question. How can I know that this fixed supply won't change in the future? How do I know we're not one pull-request away from inflationary money? How do I know that the future supply of Bitcoin won't be controlled by incompetent bureaucrats? Well, it's open-source code. Try modifying it and see what happens. Create your own pull-request to change this function. Now, obviously such a change won't be approved, but what if it was? Let's say the supply cap was changed -- would that be the end of Bitcoin? Such a change would break consensus rules, and would be considered a hard fork, that is, the original software would reject all new blocks on this new version, and it would require all the miners and nodes to upgrade. A conscious choice amongst every participant in the Bitcoin network. Those that refused would just continue as they were, running nodes, mining blocks, and transacting Bitcoin based on the 21 million fixed supply. The developers that refused would continue developing the original version and would enjoy the support of everyone who wished to stay on the original fixed supply version. This is, it turns out, exactly what has happened many many times before. The so called altcoins (or shitcoins ) are the result of exactly these kind of hard forks. Their adherents chose the hard fork, and the market reacted accordingly.

Buying a pizza or a coffee, selling a car, all are examples of using money as a medium of exchange. This is an important area where Bitcoin has a distinct advantage and a perceived disadvantage compared to traditional forms of currency such as gold and silver coins. This is also an area where fiat, for all its faults, has proven superior to gold. Simply put, using fiat payment rails for small purchases is often more usable than any alternative. Importantly, this perceived advantage of fiat as a medium of exchange hides the fact that those seemingly quick and easy payments are sitting atop an outdated and painfully inefficient system of final settlement. Final Settlement \u00b6 Money as a medium of exchange for small payments is very different than final settlement. Bitcoin is unparalleled in its ability to perform final settlement. As a digital money, Bitcoin is extremely advantageous in that it can be transacted anywhere on earth in any arbitrary amount. You don't need to look for exact change, and you don't need to mail a check. With Bitcoin you send a transaction and wait for final settlement. The ability to attain final settlement anywhere on earth in any amount and without any trusted intermediaries or authority is unprecedented, and is why Bitcoin -- if it is true -- is the most superior form of money to ever exist. This is also why Bitcoin may inevitably become the money of international settlement. However, because Bitcoin is fully decentralized and trustless, relying on transaction fees and block time , this poses a perceived disadvantage; you must wait for new blocks in order to reach final settlement. This wait plus transaction fees makes Bitcoin seemingly impractical for small purchases such as a cup of coffee. Or rather, trying to achieve final international settlement for the purchase of a cup of coffee is quite the overkill. Neither gold nor fiat provide final settlement for a cup of coffee. Gold lends itself to a system of credits and typically relied on a bimetal monetary system where silver coins acted as a medium of exchange. Fiat relies on outdated banking cores , and in practice takes weeks or months for something as simply as a cup of coffee to reach final settlement. The exception to this is cash on hand, promissory notes, which reach final settlement the moment two trusted parties transact. Cash payments are quite efficient but must be done in person, and require trust (trust in the fiat currency itself, and trust that the promissory note in question is not a counterfeit). There is no known completely trustless medium of exchange, that is, not until Bitcoin over the lightning network. Lightning Network \u00b6 Bitcoin, like the Internet itself, offers a layered architecture. Final settlement is guaranteed on the base layer, and payment networks such as the Lightning network are built on top of the base layer. You can put some Bitcoin into a lightning channel through a base layer transaction, and you can use that to buy your coffee in a fast and highly scalable payment network. Think of this as petty cash, like spending from a gift card, only faster and with verifiable payments. Meanwhile the base layer is used only for final settlement. And yet Lightning offers its own verifiable settlements. It can do this because it is built on the Bitcoin network as a 2nd layer, gaining the security and stability of the base layer. Bitcoin on the Lightning network is backed by transactions on the base layer. The movement of Bitcoin on the Lightning network simply shifts the balances between owners. E.g., if you start with 0.5 Bitcoin on the Lightning network and spend 0.1, and separately someone pays you 0.05, then your balance of 0.45 Bitcoin can be settled on the base layer. Closing a Lightning channel requires a base layer transaction. In fact, if you have an open Lightning channel, then you have a guaranteed transaction that could be made on the base layer to close that channel. That guaranteed base-layer transaction is why lightning payments can settle instantly. If you start with a guaranteed 0.5 Bitcoin, and you spend 0.1, your original \"guaranteed 0.5 Bitcoin\" transaction is replaced by one with 0.4 Bitcoin. Lightning network is merely a protocol keeping track of the guaranteed transactions that could be made on the base layer. So while base-layer settlement is slow, waiting for 3 or more confirmed blocks, Lightning settlement is instant, and that instant settlement is backed by the guaranteed transaction that could be made on the base-layer. Bitcoin as Currency \u00b6 In practice, the capacity of the Lightning network, that is, the total amount of Bitcoin in all Lightning channels, represents the circulating supply of Bitcoin as a currency, as a medium of exchange. Because of the decentralized nature of the Lightning network, it is impossible to know how much Bitcoin is being used in private Lightning channels. However, the public (discoverable) channels have seen steadily growing adoption and capacity . And importantly, despite the scaling limitations of settlement on the base-layer, Lightning transactions are infinitely scalable, easily handling millions or theoretically even billions of transactions per second. Lightning demonstrates the importance of a layered architecture as well as the importance of Bitcoin's continuous development. Before there was Lightning, Bitcoin was simply not a viable medium of exchange . Now it offers the most advanced and scalable medium of exchange that the world has ever seen.","title":"Medium of Exchange"},{"location":"bitcoin-as-money/medium-of-exchange/#bitcoin-as-a-medium-of-exchange","text":"You often hear money referred to as currency , that is, the movement of money in exchange for goods and services -- this is money as a medium of exchange .

This is because there are only 32 halvings until the block subsidy will be zero. If you were to replace the 32 with infinity , then the above equation would equal 21-million as an asymptotic limit. That is, it would take infinite time and infinite decimal places to get to 21-million. Monetary Equation \u00b6 The equation (Bitcoin's monetary policy) breaks down as follows: There are 33 block-subsidy eras (0 to 32), each lasting exactly 210,000 blocks. This means each era is roughly 4-years, for a total of 132 years till the final Satoshi is issued. Each era halves the block-subsidy, and after 32 halvings the subsidy would result in a number too small to represent in Satoshis, hence the subsidy will be zero. At that point (block 6,930,000 in the year 2140), there will have been 20,999,999.9769 Bitcoin block subsidies, and from then on Bitcoin mining will operate only on fees (which in practice will have already happened as the prior era subsidy will have already been a single Satoshi). Supply over Time \u00b6 One of the reasons Bitcoin's ledger can be referred to as a timechain is because we know the future supply schedule, e.g., we know the final Satoshi will be issued in the year 2140. This is an often overlooked point. The issuance of Bitcoin is not dependent on its value. Let's repeat that: Issuance of Bitcoin is not dependent on its value. Imagine if the spot-price of gold or silver jumped up to over $1-million. That is, an ounce of silver would fetch more than $1-million. You might go looking for old silver dollars. And how do you think this would effect silver mining? This is so fundamental as to be a law of nature. Increased demand will result in more production. And yet if Bitcoin price goes to $1-million or more, the issuance of new Bitcoin will remain on schedule. Issuance of Bitcoin depends on time. Let's repeat that: Issuance of Bitcoin depends on time. What would happen if, tomorrow, the price of Bitcoin went up to $1-million? Mining would be very profitable. The hashrate would skyrocket. And yet, issuance of new Bitcoin would stay on schedule. This is due to the difficulty adjustment. Difficulty Adjustment \u00b6 Every 2016 blocks there is a difficulty adjustment to maintain a 10-minute average block time. That is, if the average time between each of those 2016 blocks is less than 10-minutes, the difficulty will increase. If the average is more than 10-minutes, the difficulty will decrease. For this reason, while the time between blocks can vary, the average remains 10-minutes. Without a doubt, this is Satoshi Nakamoto 's greatest innovation.

If tulip prices increase, so too will tulip farming, because tulips are not a scarce asset. Increases in the valuation of Bitcoin will lead to more mining as it becomes more profitable, yet those increases will in turn lead to a difficulty adjustment such that the increased mining does not alter the supply schedule. The difficulty adjustment is why Bitcoin's monetary policy will always follow a rather predictable future supply schedule. This seemingly benign difficulty adjustment is what makes Bitcoin the scarcest asset the world has ever known. Or rather, the coalescence of a decentralized ledger, proof-of-work issuance with a difficulty adjustment, and enforced through a consensus protocol -- all of this in harmony is what make Bitcoin the scarcest and most uncorruptible asset that has ever existed.","title":"Monetary Policy"},{"location":"bitcoin-as-money/monetary-policy/#bitcoins-monetary-policy","text":"The following equation contains the entirety of Bitcoin's monetary policy: If you calculate the above summation, it is approximately 21-million. asymptotic limit Technically, the total supply of Bitcoin will be capped at 20,999,999.9769 .

Power over money is power over human choice. If a state had complete power over money then there would be no limit to that state's power over those governed. Controlling what people can and cannot buy, you would not need much law enforcement; power over money would be sufficient enforcement of all human behavior and action. Even crimes of passion would become quite difficult if one couldn't buy food or water or transportation. Complete power over money would offer total totalitarianism . Such power would render humans into something less than slaves, including those managing the money. The system itself would become all powerful, leaving humans to be obedient (in action, speech, and thought) to the monetary principalities that emerge from their own base instincts. Historically, such totalitarianism has proven impossible, collapsing under its own tyrannical fiat. As monetary technology increases, so too does monetary power. The desire from the state and others to wield this power will also increase. We can either limit technology to prevent this power from manifesting further, which puts our civilization on a dead end, or we separate money from state. Church and State \u00b6 An often overlooked consequence of the establishment clause of the first amendment of the United States is that rather than liberating politics from the corrupting influence of churches, the opposite was true. Churches, not politics, were set free. This may run contrary to conventional wisdom, to the facade of enlightenment thinking that we arrogantly ascribe, but think about it: has the political class become less corrupt as they separated themselves from religious institutions? Or have the churches lessened their own corruption as they separated from the state, and become increasingly benign places of worship? There is much to be criticized when looking at modern churches, such as their shallow banality with no more sacredness than than the strip-malls where they reside, but the inquisition they are not. To the degree a church has been separated from state, that church has been freed of the corrupting influence of the state. The same, obviously, can be true of money. Human Nature \u00b6 One cannot separate human nature from religion nor from money. There have been religions and money as long as there has been humans. The concepts of a store of wealth, of scarce and beautiful artifacts, what we can call proto-money, have existed in every ancient culture. Primitive forms of money are as universal as primitive, usually animistic, religions. Fiat Money and Ancestor Worship Look at the design of paper money and coinage.

Power over money is power over human choice. If a state had complete power over money then there would be no limit to that state's power over those governed. Controlling what people can and cannot buy, you would not need much law enforcement; power over money would be sufficient enforcement of all human behavior and action. Even crimes of passion would become quite difficult if one couldn't buy food or water or transportation. Complete power over money would offer total totalitarianism . Such power would render humans into something less than slaves, including those managing the money. The system itself would become all powerful, leaving humans to be obedient (in action, speech, and thought) to the monetary principalities that emerge from their own base instincts. Historically, such totalitarianism has proven impossible, collapsing under its own tyrannical fiat. As monetary technology increases, so too does monetary power. The desire from the state and others to wield this power will also increase. We can either limit technology to prevent this power from manifesting further, which puts our civilization on a dead end, or we separate money from state.","title":"Separation of Money and State"},{"location":"bitcoin-as-money/separation-money-and-state/#church-and-state","text":"An often overlooked consequence of the establishment clause of the first amendment of the United States is that rather than liberating politics from the corrupting influence of churches, the opposite was true. Churches, not politics, were set free. This may run contrary to conventional wisdom, to the facade of enlightenment thinking that we arrogantly ascribe, but think about it: has the political class become less corrupt as they separated themselves from religious institutions? Or have the churches lessened their own corruption as they separated from the state, and become increasingly benign places of worship? There is much to be criticized when looking at modern churches, such as their shallow banality with no more sacredness than than the strip-malls where they reside, but the inquisition they are not.

Its value should be far greater, equal to the total amount of wealth on earth. To any such criticism, one must ask, what should the price of Bitcoin be? And with what unit of account? That is, if Bitcoin should be worth more, then we can only ask: more of what? More silver? \u00b6 Early on, Bitcoin was quick to challenge the value of silver. In fact it has exceeded silver's market cap more than once. That is, if a single Bitcoin could buy more than 83 kilograms of silver, then the value of Bitcoin will be greater than silver. More gold? \u00b6 Estimates for the total supply of gold vary wildly, but based on the most accepted estimates, if a single Bitcoin could buy more than 321 ounces of gold, then the value of Bitcoin will be greater than gold. More real-estate? \u00b6 Buy land, they're not making it anymore Should Bitcoin by worth more than the total value of all land on earth? It's certainly possible to theorize on a price, a number of Satoshis per sqft, such that Bitcoin would be more valuable than all real estate. But this isn't exactly useful nor practical. Not all land is for sale, not in fiat nor gold nor Bitcoin. And the estimated market cap for real estate (over $300 trillion) is higher than the combined GDP of all all nations on earth (under $100 trillion). While we could price this at $14.3-million, it's difficult to think that there would still be a USD if Bitcoin became so valuable. As is, all the money on earth (including Bitcoin) falls short of the estimated value of all land. Even during the gold standard this was true. There is not (and never was) enough gold to buy all the land on earth. This is necessarily true because there has never been a single global unit of account (not even gold), a money that all people across all nations and ideologies agree on as their store of wealth. Even more confounding, the total value of all derivatives is measured in quadrillions of dollars, significantly higher than all the land and all the money on earth combined. Importantly, these kind of outlandish valuations are a unique phenomena that can only exist in fiat debt money. More fiat? \u00b6 Total estimates of all fiat money are impossible to measure. We're at the mercy of every central bank and nation state -- any one of which could inflate their money supply overnight (as they are wont to do). And because of this, it's impossible to calculate the minimum value of Bitcoin needed for it to exceed a given fiat currency (let alone all of them).

Fiat money is also a pure monetary premium, except its supply is theoretically infinite, and through the Cantillon effect fiat has obscured if not broken price signals in every market.

Not all land is for sale, not in fiat nor gold nor Bitcoin. And the estimated market cap for real estate (over $300 trillion) is higher than the combined GDP of all all nations on earth (under $100 trillion). While we could price this at $14.3-million, it's difficult to think that there would still be a USD if Bitcoin became so valuable. As is, all the money on earth (including Bitcoin) falls short of the estimated value of all land. Even during the gold standard this was true. There is not (and never was) enough gold to buy all the land on earth. This is necessarily true because there has never been a single global unit of account (not even gold), a money that all people across all nations and ideologies agree on as their store of wealth.

This is the recommended approach and it is also the only way to properly secure your Bitcoin. With self custody you could decide that you'd rather die than give up your Bitcoin; that it will go to your children or else to no one. This may sound silly and rather extreme, but Bitcoin is the only asset in the history of the world where you can meaningfully accomplish this level of ownership.

In practice, self custody is as easy as changing a light-bulb, and it is vastly easier than online banking, not to mention far more secure. Bitcoin is as secure as you want it to be, from trivial to nuclear-launch-code level of security. Bitcoin is hard? Compared to what?! Let's look at the security setup for accessing a typical online banking service, and determine how easy and secure things really are. Typical Online Banking The bank requires a \"strong password\", the kind recommended by security experts. You use a Password Manager to generate \"strong passwords\", and your online banking password is something like CH\"sgK9'?f<WZWYS . The bank requires multi-factor authentication (MFA), and you've been told by security experts not to rely on SMS text messages for MFA, so you install an IdP app, which requires its own password with optional biometric verification. You generate another \"strong password\" for your IdP app, this one is DVqt*\\Hax2$YD5vK . The bank asks for your email address and asks you to verify it. You realize your email can be used to reset passwords, and fortunately you've already enabled MFA for your email service and used a \"strong password\", which is c9~%C8UMNp+ung9= . The bank also requires AML/KYC, so you provide them copies of your passport and you upload an image of yourself holding your passport along with a piece of paper that has your written signature and today's date. You feel stupid sending your bank a selfie, but you do it anyway. The bank also asks you to select and answer three \"security questions\", and you go with your high-school mascot, name of your first pet, and the city you met your significant other ( Cherokees, Rex, Hoboken ). The password manager also requires its own \"strong password\" and in case you forget that one, they provide you a \"secret key\" that they recommend you print out and keep someplace safe. This \"secret key\" they tell you, can be used to recover all of your passwords, so you have to keep it very safe. You write down the following on a piece of paper, 6QRDjV7MmznW63yjZWM5c8ngC5rxQhZxAPXrzfuYbg8CZuLT and you put that paper in a fire-proof lockbox. We could keep going with this all-too-common tale of security theater (and you've no doubt already experienced much of this), but let's pause here and analyze how easy and how secure this system really is -- Security Review In practice, your personal information has certainly been leaked out to the dark web multiple times (through any one of the high-profile data breaches that you read about in the news). Tying your wealth to personal information is generally a bad idea, but impossible to avoid with institutional custody. A fire-proof lockbox would not preserve a piece of paper through a house fire. Regardless, there's a much bigger problem -- a barely competent hacker could call your bank and impersonate you. With a quick glance at your social media, they could answer the security questions ( Cherokees, Rex, Hoboken ), then they reset the password, change the security questions, liquidate the account, and finally they close the account. If this happens, you'll find yourself locked out of your own account, and after weeks of calling the bank and getting a lawyer involved you will eventually learn what happened. Your account was liquidated. The bank assumes no responsibility, and they give you the number for the FBI. They blame the whole ordeal on your weak security questions and point to the terms and services that you signed (but never read). In case it's not obvious, online banking is vastly more complicated than anything you'll encounter with Bitcoin. And you'll find all the same cryptographic concepts, such as private keys and recovery seeds , but the bank and apps will apply them in comically useless ways that add no real security and still manage to leave you vulnerable. No reasonable person would conclude that the current state of online security is easy. Securing your identity across disparate technology and banking providers is not easy. And worse, it is getting harder and harder by the day. But is self custody really as easy as changing a light-bulb? Yes, and definitely easier than the security theater of online banking. Bitcoin is new and can seem complicated. But imagine asking a person from the middle ages to change a light bulb. They'd be confused and without explicit instructions they would probably electrocute themselves. Bitcoin is no different. Future generations may laugh at us for being so hopelessly ignorant of what will seem obvious and intuitive to them. Really, It's Easy \u00b6 Securing your assets in the traditional fiat banking system requires a Rube-Goldberg-Machine of security-theater where telling a call-center operator in the Philipines your mother's maiden name somehow constitutes security. Bitcoin self custody offers real security. And thus the risk of losing your funds in traditional banking is far higher than any reasonable self custody solution. Sounds like banking. Why would I want to be a bank? You don't, and that's the point. Bitcoin allows superior custody services that no bank or institution will ever be able to match.

QR Code Reader \u00b6 You will need a camera to read the QA Code of the PSBT Micro SD \u00b6 Alternatively, and this method is tricky to ensure an airgap, you can copy the PSBT from a MicroSD card or USB thumb drive. Importantly, the same device should NOT be used to transfer the signed transaction back to a networked device -- doing so will violate the quarantine. Output Device \u00b6 This is the most sensitive and high-risk part of a Bitcoin transaction, as you must take data from the quarantined device and broadcast it to the Bitcoin network. The risk of breaking the airgap quanrantine is highest here. QR Code Display \u00b6 You will need a device with a camera to be in proximity of the airgapped device, this is itself risky, so precautions must be taken (see protocols) Printed QR Code \u00b6 If you have a secure printer, one that you know cannot be remotely exploited then you can simply print the QR code of the signed transaction, and then scan that printed QR code later on any trusted Internet connected device.

Bitcoin is unlike any money the world has seen. It is unlike any technology or network -- there's really nothing like it in history. As a result, any attempt at explaining Bitcoin will rely either on imperfect metaphors, or novel technical terms. For example, the word custody is a misnomer, an anachronism from a simpler time when banks would custody your money. In reality, there are no actual coins to custody. Bitcoin is pure information; information copied publicly in a cryptographic ledger. Everyone can have a copy of the ledger, and everyone can validate that the ledger is correct. And similar to how the Internet empowered individuals to share ideas with the world, Bitcoin empowers individuals to custody their wealth, and to do so in ways far more secure than any bank ever could. And because Bitcoin is money, there are many traditional metaphors (such as wallets , coins , and addresses ) that can be useful, but at the same time may lead to a great deal of confusion. Bitcoin is in a category all to itself -- the physical limitations of custody , wallets , coins , and addresses simply don't apply to Bitcoin. And thus to custody your Bitcoin, means something very different than anything you've thought about before Bitcoin. We will describe these imperfect metaphors and attempt to demystify them, and then discuss the more accurate technical concepts necessary for understanding the truth of Bitcoin and what it really means to custody your Bitcoin . Wallets \u00b6 In Bitcoin, the word wallet is a misnomer, possibly the most confusing metaphor in Bitcoin. The term wallet in Bitcoin can mean different things. It can refer to a collection of private keys, or invoice addresses, or UTXO sets, or as the hardware or software to manage any of the above. But a Bitcoin wallet is most certainly NOT a collection of your Bitcoin. There is no Bitcoin stored in a Bitcoin wallet. The traditional meaning of the word wallet simply doesn't apply to Bitcoin. The word wallet was used in Bitcoin because the original Bitcoin core client app would store private keys in a file named wallet.dat . Hot Wallet \u00b6 A hot wallet refers to any software or hardware that stores your private keys in a device connected to the Internet, allowing you to send and receive Bitcoin. If a private key is directly accessible to an online device, this makes it hot . E.g., if you have a Bitcoin wallet app on your phone that can send and receive Bitcoin, this is referred to as a hot wallet . Cold Storage Wallet \u00b6 If you store private keys offline, in a device never connected to the Internet, this is referred to as cold storage . There are obvious security benefits, and cold storage is the recommended approach for safe custody of your Bitcoin. There are many cold storage practices, and they follow a standard pattern, private keys are stored offline (e.g., in an air-gapped device). public keys can be stored in an Internet-connected device. for receiving Bitcoin, the public key can generate receive addresses, and verify transactions. for sending Bitcoin, the public key can generate an unsigned transaction , then the unsigned transaction is transfered to the air-gapped device, then the transaction is signed on the air-gapped device, then the signed transaction is transfered to an Internet-connected device, and then broadcast to the network. There are many variations of cold storage but they all adhere to the above pattern; sometimes with additional steps meant to increase security. E.g., using a seed signer, a private key is never stored in any electronic device, air-gapped or otherwise. Instead the key is generated from the seed phrase and used on a signing device only when needed (and discarded immediately afterwards). Wallets Demystified \u00b6 A Bitcion wallet is not a collection of your Bitcoin. Rather, a Bitcoin wallet is any device or procedure used to manage your private keys (necessary to send and receive Bitcoin). This includes hardware wallets , as well as protocols to manage private keys. Keys \u00b6 Not your keys, not your Bitcoin. It is your Bitcoin keys that you custody. Specifically, you custody your private keys, usually by storing the seed phrase that can generate your private keys and their corresponding public keys. If you're unfamiliar with these concepts ( public key cryptography and elliptic-curve cryptography ), the purpose is that public keys can create encrypted information that can only be decrypted by the corresponding private keys . Or in the case of Bitcoin, public keys can create transaction outputs that can only be spent by the corresponding private keys . In other words, you can receive Bitcoin through your public keys (or rather, addresses generated by your public keys), and you can spend Bitcoin by using your private keys . A seed phrase is a list of words that encode a 256-bit number that can derive private keys and their corresponding public keys, as well as the addresses that can be used in transactions. In other words, it is a phrase (typically 24 words) that can be used to recover your Bitcoin. This process of deriving keys and addresses from a seed phrase is knows as Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) Wallets . Hierarchical Determinism \u00b6 In practice, Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) Wallets allow you to save a single seed phrase and use that seed to derive as many keys and addresses as you need. This could be as simple as a single account with a single key that you use only once, or this could be millions of accounts used by an instition, such that each account can generate its own keys and addresses. Brief History Early version of Bitcoin generated private keys and addresses randomly, requiring users to backup all of the private keys associated with any of the addresses they had used. HD wallets on the other hand can generate an unlimited number of private keys and addresses, or rather, an unlimited number of accounts, each with their own keys and address space. And all of those accounts, keys, and addresses can be derived from a single seed phrase. Keys Demystified \u00b6 Public keys are used to receive Bitcoin, and private keys are used to spend Bitcoin (by signing a transaction). A seed phrase can be backed up and is used to generate public and private keys in a predictable (deterministic) way, such that your seed phrase is the most critical piece of information to secure. Addresses \u00b6 A Bitcoin address is a misnomer, and when not understood properly can lead to a great deal of confusion. The word address implies your Bitcoin is located at this address. In reality, there is no address where your Bitcoin is located. There are only transactions, which have inputs and outputs, and the outputs are either spent or unspent. Transaction inputs are created from the unspent outputs of a previous transaction. And these ouputs are created using an address. This makes the unspent transaction outputs spendable only by the corresponding private key associated with the address. There are two types of addresses, receive addresses (also known as invoice addresses) and change addresses. Invoice Addresses \u00b6 Imagine you receive 0.006 Bitcoin to an address in your wallet. This will create a transaction with an output using your address. flowchart LR subgraph TX-1 direction LR subgraph in-1[in] direction LR a[0.006 BTC] end subgraph out-1[out] direction LR b[0.006 BTC] end end a --> b Then you send 0.001 Bitcoin to someone else (to an invoice address they sent you). It is tempting to think your original address now has 0.005 Bitcoin, but in reality your original address has nothing. The original transaction output is spent . When you send the 0.001 Bitcoin, this will create a new transaction with two outputs: flowchart LR subgraph TX-1 direction RL subgraph in-1[in] direction RL a[0.006 BTC] end subgraph out-1[out] direction RL b[0.006 BTC] end end subgraph TX-2 direction TB subgraph in-2[in] direction RL c[0.006 BTC] end subgraph out-2[out] direction BT d[0.001 BTC] end subgraph out-2a[out] direction BT e[0.005 BTC] end end a --> b in-2 --> out-2 in-2 --> out-2a b --> in-2 One output has 0.001 Bitcoin , and another with 0.005 Bitcoin (for simplicity, this is ignoring transaction fees). Your private key can access the output with 0.005 Bitcoin , and someone else has the private key to access the output with 0.001 Bitcoin . The output at 0.005 Bitcoin uses a change address . The original transaction output of 0.006 Bitcoin is already spent, and your Bitcoin is only available in the new unspent transaction outputs . These unspent transaction ouputs are known as UTXOs (see below). Change Addresses \u00b6 Here is a real transaction where someone spent 0.001 Bitcoin from a previous UTXO address that contained 0.006 Bitcoin . In addition to a transaction fee of 0.00007718 Bitcoin , there was 0.00492282 Bitcoin sent to a change address . Every invoice address has a corresponding change address , which as the name implies, is the change of the spent transaction output. Addresses Demystified \u00b6 An address is not a location where Bitcoin is stored, but is a number used to generate a transaction output (see UTXOs below). An invoice address (aka receive address ), is what you would use to receive Bitcoin. And when you spend Bitcoin (from an unspent transaction), any remainder will use a change address . Transactions \u00b6 Bitcoin is a protocol managing a cryptographic ledger, and this ledger is made up of ordered transactions . Transactions are ordered through blocks , such that a block is merely a collection of transactions. A transaction has inputs and an outputs. The inputs must come from one or more unspent outputs of prior transactions. The only exception is the special coinbase transaction, which is the reward given to whoever successfully mined a new block (thus it has no input from a prior transaction). Otherwise, all transactions are composed of inputs from previously unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs). flowchart LR subgraph TX-1 direction TB subgraph in-1[in] direction TB a[0.25 BTC] end subgraph in-1a[in] direction TB a1[0.25 BTC] end subgraph out-1[out] direction BT b[0.5 BTC] end end subgraph TX-2 direction TB subgraph in-2[in] direction RL c[0.5 BTC] end subgraph out-2[out] direction BT d[0.1 BTC] end subgraph out-2a[out] direction BT e[0.4 BTC] end end in-1 --> out-1 in-1a --> out-1 in-2 --> out-2 in-2 --> out-2a out-1 --> in-2 UTXOs \u00b6 As the name implies, an Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) is Bitcoin that has not been spent. The Bitcoin you custody will be in UTXOs. UTXOs represent the total amount of addressable Bitcoin at any given time. Every UTXO contains an address such that the UTXO can only be spent by the private key (or keys) associated with that address. Transactions Demystified \u00b6 Transactions are simply the movement of Bitcoin on the ledger, such that the entire supply of all Bitcoin can be accounted for. A transaction is simply inputs and outputs which move the balance of Bitcoin to different cryptographic addresses (accessible only by private keys). Blockchain \u00b6 The word \"blockchain\" is perhaps the most misunderstood and overhyped word related to Bitcoin. Next time you read an article on \"blockchain technology\" replace the word \"blockchain\" with \"magic\" and you won't have changed the article's meaning. blockchain or magic? All the data in blockchain magic technology is immutable and can be adapted for use in a variety of industries, including healthcare, supply chain management, and voting. A blockchain , like the name implies, is simply a chain of blocks. And a block is a collection of transactions. That's it. It's an implementation detail as interesting as a linked list . And if you consider it a distributed database, it is a slow and inefficient database. By itself a blockchain is not secure; it is as mutable as any other data; and it has none of the magic often associated with it (by those easily confused by the subtle differences between technology and magic). A blockchain offers absolutely no value to healthcare, supply chain management, or voting. Ultimately, a blockchain only makes sense in the context of a proof of work (PoW) consenus mechanism whose security comes from the considerable cost of work in the PoW. Proof of Work \u00b6 A typical blockchain diagram will look something like this, Each block has a hash. A block hash is a sha256 of the entire block itself (which includes the previous block hash). This is a cryptographic function that takes any input (in this case a block) and generates a 256-bit number as output. A block can be referenced by its hash as well as by block height (starting at 1). Here are some examples of actual block hashes: Genesis -> 00000000839a8e6886ab5951d76f411475428afc90947ee320161bbf18eb6048 100100 -> 0000000000020ee4806021c0b6e7b97d31df0c2fdbd0f6c3a7cb5883c7bc151f 200201 -> 00000000000000e510b96fcf03e27ad30f8d50e4cd4cb7cf4c06cf7ffb9add3e 300301 -> 00000000000000002887537d323675f79cc5eddce91b3c0dd433739cbfe9c823 700700 -> 00000000000000000000e55da58b378880e797f9f3e96811d3e64a2f801eed9a These hashes have a lot of leading zeroes, and as time goes on, the number of leading zeroes seems to increase. This is due to proof of work (and network difficulty increasing over time). There is a common misnomer that PoW involves solving a difficult mathematical problem. In fact, all PoW does is provide a verifiable block hash that is smaller than the current network difficulty. In other words, the hash is simply a number (a 256-bit number) that is smaller than the network difficulty number. This is why you see leading zeroes. The reason this is a proof of work is because generating a valid block requires massive amounts of work. A Bitcoin miner constantly adjusts a proposed block (see the nonce in the header) and generates a sha256 hash, essentially a guess. Every miner repeats this, over and over, until finally -- and by dumb luck -- the hash is smaller than the network difficulty. If the hash is valid (adhering to consensus rules) then the rest of the network will accept the proposed block. There is also a timestamp field in each block, meaning the Bitcoin network is also a distributed timestamp server. This allows the PoW blockchain to keep track of time. And due to what is known as the difficulty adjustment , the network will adjust the difficulty number in order to maintain a 10-minute average block time. The difficulty will adjust every 2016 blocks (roughly every 2-weeks; and 2016 reversed is 6102, a subtle reference to executive order 6102 ). This is why the PoW blockchain is more aptly known as the Bitcoin timechain . Timechain \u00b6 The PoW blockchain is better known as a timechain because it provides a chronological order to all transactions, creating its own time in the process. From the whitepaper , Bitcoin provides \"a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions\" . In other words, Bitcoin provides order that lays itself out over time; that is, we know the precise order of transactions, as well as the future supply of Bitcoin. We can predict with high accuracy what the Bitcoin supply will be at any point in the future (something you cannot do with gold or fiat). The timechain does not repeat. There are no circular paths in Bitcoin time. It is linear, keeping a pulse, a new block, every 10-minutes on average. Symbolically, Bitcoin is bringing order out of monetary chaos. What was once chaotic and unknowable (how much money is there and how is it distributed), is now knowable with Bitcoin in a true sense of the word order (order out of chaos). Blockchain Demystified \u00b6 A blockchain is a chain of blocks, nothing fancy nor magic. What changed the world was not the invention of a blockchain (something that already existed as far back as the 1990s ). What changed the world was the invention of Bitcoin, a distributed timestamp server with a PoW consensus mechanism and difficulty adjustment, giving us the most sound money to ever exist. Focusing on a blockchain as innovation is like focusing on how the Wright brothers invented a wing rather than manned flight; meanwhile Bitcoin is the invention of digital scarcity and a new form of money.","title":"Imperfect Metaphors"},{"location":"custody/imperfect-metaphors/#imperfect-metaphors","text":"Bitcoin is unlike anything that has ever existed.

By itself a blockchain is not secure; it is as mutable as any other data; and it has none of the magic often associated with it (by those easily confused by the subtle differences between technology and magic). A blockchain offers absolutely no value to healthcare, supply chain management, or voting. Ultimately, a blockchain only makes sense in the context of a proof of work (PoW) consenus mechanism whose security comes from the considerable cost of work in the PoW.","title":"Blockchain"},{"location":"custody/imperfect-metaphors/#proof-of-work","text":"A typical blockchain diagram will look something like this, Each block has a hash. A block hash is a sha256 of the entire block itself (which includes the previous block hash). This is a cryptographic function that takes any input (in this case a block) and generates a 256-bit number as output. A block can be referenced by its hash as well as by block height (starting at 1). Here are some examples of actual block hashes: Genesis -> 00000000839a8e6886ab5951d76f411475428afc90947ee320161bbf18eb6048 100100 -> 0000000000020ee4806021c0b6e7b97d31df0c2fdbd0f6c3a7cb5883c7bc151f 200201 -> 00000000000000e510b96fcf03e27ad30f8d50e4cd4cb7cf4c06cf7ffb9add3e 300301 -> 00000000000000002887537d323675f79cc5eddce91b3c0dd433739cbfe9c823 700700 -> 00000000000000000000e55da58b378880e797f9f3e96811d3e64a2f801eed9a These hashes have a lot of leading zeroes, and as time goes on, the number of leading zeroes seems to increase. This is due to proof of work (and network difficulty increasing over time). There is a common misnomer that PoW involves solving a difficult mathematical problem. In fact, all PoW does is provide a verifiable block hash that is smaller than the current network difficulty. In other words, the hash is simply a number (a 256-bit number) that is smaller than the network difficulty number. This is why you see leading zeroes. The reason this is a proof of work is because generating a valid block requires massive amounts of work. A Bitcoin miner constantly adjusts a proposed block (see the nonce in the header) and generates a sha256 hash, essentially a guess. Every miner repeats this, over and over, until finally -- and by dumb luck -- the hash is smaller than the network difficulty. If the hash is valid (adhering to consensus rules) then the rest of the network will accept the proposed block. There is also a timestamp field in each block, meaning the Bitcoin network is also a distributed timestamp server. This allows the PoW blockchain to keep track of time. And due to what is known as the difficulty adjustment , the network will adjust the difficulty number in order to maintain a 10-minute average block time. The difficulty will adjust every 2016 blocks (roughly every 2-weeks; and 2016 reversed is 6102, a subtle reference to executive order 6102 ). This is why the PoW blockchain is more aptly known as the Bitcoin timechain .","title":"Proof of Work"},{"location":"custody/imperfect-metaphors/#timechain","text":"The PoW blockchain is better known as a timechain because it provides a chronological order to all transactions, creating its own time in the process. From the whitepaper , Bitcoin provides \"a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions\" . In other words, Bitcoin provides order that lays itself out over time; that is, we know the precise order of transactions, as well as the future supply of Bitcoin. We can predict with high accuracy what the Bitcoin supply will be at any point in the future (something you cannot do with gold or fiat). The timechain does not repeat. There are no circular paths in Bitcoin time. It is linear, keeping a pulse, a new block, every 10-minutes on average. Symbolically, Bitcoin is bringing order out of monetary chaos. What was once chaotic and unknowable (how much money is there and how is it distributed), is now knowable with Bitcoin in a true sense of the word order (order out of chaos).","title":"Timechain"},{"location":"custody/imperfect-metaphors/#blockchain-demystified","text":"A blockchain is a chain of blocks, nothing fancy nor magic.

You will need to transfer the seed phrase to a secure airgapped computer and generate a checksum, however everything before that can be done by hand. I recommend using 8-sided dice that have been verified through a saltwater balance test . This will make the mapping much easier because an 8-sided dice corresponds exactly to 3-bits of entropy. Use the following chart to map each number to its binary equivalient. 8D dice roll 3-bits 1 001 2 010 3 011 4 100 5 101 6 110 7 111 8 000 Each number on the dice corresponds directly to its binary representation, except 8, which in binary is \"1000\" and so this is just the lower 3-bits of 8 in binary. Because an 8-sided dice maps perfectly into 3-bits, it is very easy to roll and record the entropy bits directly in binary. Write Dice Rolls in Binary \u00b6 Each word in the seed phrase is exactly 11-bits (2048 possibilities). And each dice roll will provide 3-bits. You'll want to keep rolling until you fill out all but the last 11-bit word, and 3-bits of the 24th word. As you fill out 3-bits at a time, you can go left-to-right and top-down, and stop after writing 3-bits into the 24th word. The remaining 8-bits of the final word are calculated through a checksum which we'll discuss next. What about 12-Word Seeds? You could also do 12-word seeds, which will give you 128-bits of entropy. You'll fill out 11 of the 11-bit words and 7-bits of the 12th word. The remaining 4-bits will be the checksum. In either case, you'll need to compute the checksum to arrive at a valid final word. This simple checksum is to ensure that you've got a valid seed phrase. A common approach is to add an additional passphrase to the seed words, like a 13th or 25th word, but not constrained to the BIP-39 word list. This passphrase can provide additional bits of entropy, and using a strong passphrase can easily add enough entropy to make a 12-word plus passphrase seed as strong as a 24-word seed. Complete the Checksum \u00b6 Completing the final word requires a checksum. In this case a sha256sum of the 256-bits of entropy. Remember the 24th word has 8-bits for the checksum, which should be the first 8-bits of the shasum. This may sound complicated, but you can use the same secure airgapped computer you plan on using to sign transactions and Self Custody your Bitcoin. If you're just testing this approach feel free to use any computer to calculate the checksum bits. You will run the following shell command, and you'll need to type your exact binary number. For brevity, I will use 010...001 to represent the full 256-bit binary number seen in the worksheet above. $ echo 010 ...001 | shasum -a 256 -0 bbcb5d63c87ee0b833f656ae55db8e4ba0f0d4f8cab91be038b5c32de106696a $ To compute the same using python is a little more involved, but helpful if you want to verify. python sha256sum >>> import hashlib >>> import binascii >>> >>> bin_str = '0101101110110011011101010011011111001010001101010111010000011101111001010110000000001100110010000000110100001111010011000011010000110010000111010000110100111001101111010110001001011001111111000000100010110010011000010111010000110000010011000011010010001001' >>> entropy_hex = format ( int ( bin_str , 2 ), '064x' ) >>> hex_bytes = binascii . a2b_hex ( entropy_hex ) >>> hashlib . sha256 ( hex_bytes ) . hexdigest () 'bbcb5d63c87ee0b833f656ae55db8e4ba0f0d4f8cab91be038b5c32de106696a' >>> The shasum is a Base-16 (hexidecimal) number, representing the 256-bit shasum of the entropy bits we got from the dice rolls. bbcb5d63c87ee0b833f656ae55db8e4ba0f0d4f8cab91be038b5c32de106696a To get the checksum needed for our 24th word, take the first two hexidecimal digits of the shasum, in this case bb , and convert to binary. Each hexidecimal digit is exactly 4-bits, and b is 1011 , so bb is 10111011 If you are not sure how to convert hexidecimal digits to binary, or you want to verify you did it correctly, you can verify in python, >>> format ( int ( \"bb\" , 16 ), \"08b\" ) '10111011' >>> Once you have the first 8 binary digits of the shasum, simply add those 8-bits to the worksheet to complete your 24th word. The 3-bits from dice plus the 8-bits from the shasum will complete all 11-bits of the final word. Seed Word Lookup \u00b6 Now that you have all the binary values, you can resolve each of the 24 values to its corresponding BIP-39 seed word . There are many ways to do this, and a helpful place to start is to reference a printable version of the BIP-39 words. There are many examples online, and I have included one here, BIP39-words.txt 0 00000000000 abandon 1 00000000001 ability 2 00000000010 able ... 2045 11111111101 zero 2046 11111111110 zone 2047 11111111111 zoo In practice, I find trying to match the binary extremely difficult. And instead I opted to convert each of the 11-bit numbers to decimal. You can do this fairly quickly if you're good at adding numbers that are all powers of 2 (e.g., 512 + 64 + 8 = 584).

While I have minor gripes (address reuse, lack of BIP-39 support, blind trust in casino dice, etc) there is no serious criticism I can find or have found concerning a security weakness in the glacier protocol.

This can be as simple as using a coldcard or trezor and following their excellent documentation, or methodically following the electrum coldstorage steps. You may also want a more holistic view of self custody security, such as, 10x Security Bitcoin Guide Glacier Protocol (recommended) Additionally, you can find excellent resources to learn about security and online privacy, such as, surveillance self-defense security-in-a-box","title":"Protocols"},{"location":"custody/protocols/#why-a-protocol","text":"One of the reasons I recommend the Glacier Protocol is because it is broken down into subprotocols (setup, deposit, withdrawal) each with step-by-step instructions. All individual steps are easy, and yet if you follow all steps you will have one of the most secure self custody solutions on the planet. While I have minor gripes (address reuse, lack of BIP-39 support, blind trust in casino dice, etc) there is no serious criticism I can find or have found concerning a security weakness in the glacier protocol. However, some may find that this approach is too much and they want something simpler. And still others may find that it is not enough (such as wanting full privacy and verifying every transaction through secured full nodes). In these cases it is recommended to have a custom protocol.","title":"Why a protocol?"},{"location":"custody/protocols/#how-much-security-do-you-want","text":"The security of your Bitcoin custody can range from trivial to nuclear-launch-code level of security. On the trivial side, a mobile app hot wallet may be perfectly reasonable for someone who isn't too concerned with losing their funds. On the paranoid side you may wish to secure your Bitcoin from hostile nation states such as North Korea or Canada . If you start with the basics, such as following the excellent coldcard docs, you'll have secured your wealth far better than any bank ever could. This is the baseline for a secure self custody protocol. We will not discuss anything less secure than this.
