Bitcoin -- if it is true -- fixes all of the problems of fiat money, even modern art. The problem of fiat money \u00b6 Bitcoin was designed to fix the problem of fiat money, which is the problem of politics and money, an incessant problem that has burdened human civilization throughout history. You may have gotten into Bitcoin as an investment; a high-risk and volatile investment; an investment into the best performing asset of all time. And yet, Bitcoin was not designed to be an investment. Bitcoin was designed to be money, sound money that can fix the problems of fiat money -- it is in this regard that we ask: is Bitcoin true? The problems of fiat money run deep, beyond the ever-increasing price of meat and potatoes -- shaping Politics and War, Food and Health, Education and Research, Science and Innovation -- and yes, even modern art . Even modern art? \u00b6 modern art under fiat This is an actual piece of art -- that sold . There are many such examples, along with eye-roll inducing apologetics, such that the banana represents a critique of the very problems of modern art that everyone is criticizing. Janitors protested the banana for pay inequality, another artist ate the banana, and still another wrote \"Epstein didn't kill himself\" on the wall in red lipstick. Even the artists and the art dealers know that modern art is vapid nonsense, and so they perform self-referential pieces of art, criticising themselves, being cynical about cynicism -- someone will then call the self-referential cynicism \"genius\" -- and why stop if the money keeps rolling in? Rather than ask what is and what is not art, instead ask how art collectors have money for this kind of art, and why they see value in it. And most importantly, find out where that money came from. Where does money come from? \u00b6 Money operates as a measure of value, subjective value based on the perceptions of those buying and selling. Money also stores value, value to be used in the future. The time between earning money and spending money is known as \"saving\". This simple and subjective sense of value is all that money is and ever will be. It is best understood as a technology, such that good money will be more efficient than bad money. It can be strong money with a fixed supply, or it can be easy money with an inflationary supply. Inflationary money disprupts the natural cycle of saving, replacing the age old \"saving for the future\" with consumerism, with credit and debt, with a system of constant spending -- because money that constantly loses value is simply worth more now than it will be in the future. Worse, fiat money is inflationary at the whims of those who control the money supply. There is a reason janitors have less purchasing power than ever before. And it's not because a wealthy person controlled this outcome. If you are janitor earning fiat money, you will work harder and harder, but you will earn less and less value over time . And that amount of lost value will be gained by those known as cantilion insiders, those close to the money supply, those who benefit from increases in the money supply, including art collectors. An art collector's salary will also lose value over time, just like the janitor. However, assets such as real-estate and art will increase in value. Inflating the money supply doesn't just drive up prices of consumer goods, it first inflates the value of hard assets, transfering wealth from those who work and save, to those who own hard assets. And if you dig deep enough, you'll find that most art collectors don't actually earn a salary, have never earned a salary, and that their wealth is not stored in cash. Political solultions make the problem worse, and over time those controlling the money supply use their ill-gotten gains (known as seigniorage ) to control the politics (regardless of the system), so it inevitably becomes a rigged game (be it a democracy or theocracy or socialist dictatorship or otherwise). Revolutions change the faces of the problem, but like the word implies, a revolution is to move in a circle. There is no political solution. If you ever wonder why seemingly diverse modern societies are struggling with consumerism, environmental catastrophes, health epidemics where supposedly \"wealthy\" populations are malnourished and dying younger, and fighting endless wars over control of oil -- look no further than the source of all this misery -- fiat money, where unaccountable bureaucrats control the supply of money at the expense of civilization itself. While the current round of non-sustainable monetary parasitism began in 1971 , this problem is as old as time. Whether it's causal or not can be debated, but societies fall when their money is debased (just ask the Romans). No reasonable person can believe otherwise. The real question becomes, what can be done about the problem of fiat money? The terrifying truth \u00b6 If Bitcoin is true, it is almost too terrifying to contemplate. Bitcoin simply could not succeed in an honest system. It is merely a set of protocols around a cryptographic ledger designed to prevent any and all centralized control of money; it requires voluntary participation; it is designed such that no one can or will control the monetary policy . As a consequence of its design, it is slow and less efficient than what a non-corrupt centralized system could achieve. It is only superior to corrupt dishonest systems (because it fixes the bad-actor problem). If Bitcoin is true it would mean that the problems of fiat money are not only real but irreconciliable. It would mean our entire system is built on lies, and that our leaders are parasitic sociopaths, selected by broken incentives that benefit short-term gains at the expense of the future, unknowingly destroying civilization in the process. And it means that we are participants in this lie. For Americans it means Nixon was worse than liberals believe, and that FDR was even worse than Nixon. It means our media is corrupt propaganda, and that our political parties are nothing but the coordinators of this propaganda. And none of this is by design but as a consequence of the fiat system itself; of the broken incentives that reward short-term gains at the expense of civilization. Such a system will discourage you from ever discovering, where does money come from? This is a lot to take in for even a cynical person. You've been lied to about money, by people who aren't particularly competent, told that money doesn't grow on trees and then to look the other way when money is created from nothing; all by the whims of parasitic sociopaths that know not what they do. It's tempting to believe the lies, either that they don't exist (it's all just a conspiracy theory) or to believe they exist and are competent enough to actually control money. But the terrifying truth is that they do exist, but are completely incompetent. They don't understand that one cannot actually control money. No one can control money , because money relies on the ever-changing perspectives of value of every person on earth. Money is technology Money is the technology that allows for the ever-changing perspectives of value (of every human on earth) to be made known and measurable, that is, to have what are known as prices and markets . Money requires freedom, freedom to change your mind on a whim, to change your perception of value based on the ever-changing demands in your life. One cannot control money without controlling the subjective values of every person on earth, controlling not just their thoughts, but their innate sense of value, and all the externalities that might cause them to react, rendering them less than cattle, less than rats, something more akin to cogs in a machine, a machine that is controlled by -- who exactly? \"Bitcoin fixes this\" \u00b6 This oft-repeated quote struck me as too good to be true, the wishful thinking of youthful idealists who are all theory with no real-world experience, those unprepared for the chaotic realpolitik of life. And yet, if what is claimed about Bitcoin is true, then it could fix the damaging effects of inflationary money. If the supply is truly scarce, now and in the future; and if the network is truly decentralized, such that no system of authority can control or kill it, then yes, logically, Bitcoin could fix many of the problems of fiat money. But like I said, that all seems too good to be true. Like trying to contemplate what life would be like if people were always honest and forthright; if everyone was kind, humble, and forgiving. People aren't always that way, and it's not helpful to pretend otherwise. And yet, Bitcoin assumes the opposite, that no one can be trusted. don't trust, verify The entire design of Bitcoin is a trustless system that assumes no one is honest. No one. You must verify everything. If there's something we can't verify, then trust is required, in which case we're back to fiat, back to the very problem that Bitcoin is trying to solve. For Bitcoin to be true, everything must be verifiable. Why not other Cryptocurrencies? \u00b6 Altcoins are not attempting to solve the problem Bitcoin solves. They offer no scarcity, and no true decentralization. Most are free market monies that operate as securities. They sometimes offer interesting features because they're digital money, but without scarcity over time. Most are merely copies of Bitcoin but with a centralized source of control, completely defeating the point, which is why you will hear them referred to as \"shitcoins\". Shitcoins cannot solve the problem of fiat money. And they don't try. In all cases they are attempting to become fiat money, granting seigniorage to their own founders. Bitcoin is in a category all its own, a scarce digital resource, a superior money. If Bitcoin is true, then it wins in the end, outcompeting all other money, potentially redeeming civilization in the process. Anything less than that would prove Bitcoin false. What if Bitcoin is false? \u00b6 What if in our journey to verify everything we miss something? And years later we realize that there was a flaw, something we didn't see, but it becomes obvious once exploited. That's all it would take to prove Bitcoin false -- one small counterexample, a flaw that could not be fixed in a soft fork. If trust was required, then that trust could be exploited -- and those who most effectively violate that trust would become the de-facto controllers of Bitcoin, making it no better than fiat. What then? Nothing will have been fixed. The unsustainable problems of fiat would continue in crisis after crisis. However, having learned about Bitcoin you'll understand money. The chaos of the moderm world will make sense. And you'll realize we needed Bitcoin to be true because there was no alternative. Whether we like it or not, the survival of our civilization depends on overcoming the problem of fiat money. This is the challenge of our generation. The existential threats facing our civilization all point back to fiat money. We cannot solve environmental crises, health crises, meaning crises, or any of the problems in education or politics, not without fixing the broken incentives that created those problems to begin with. Bitcoin has been referred to as energy money , one of the great filters to the advancement of civilization. This is a polite way of saying that civilization cannot advance when parasitic bureaucrats play God through vain attempts at controlling money. But this also means, for Bitcoin to be true, it must succeed as energy money ; it must be the catalyst to advance our civilization. All Bitcoin would have to do is work. Every day that it works is another day that it has not been proven false. We can dare to hope; we can look for criticisms ; or we can support Bitcoin's ascent as a true form of energy money that redeems civilization. The stakes are higher than we can imagine, and what happens next, for better or worse, is up to us.","title":"Is Bitcoin True?"},{"location":"is-bitcoin-true/#is-bitcoin-true","text":"One of my earliest reactions to a deep dive into Bitcoin, was the thought, Bitcoin fixes modern art?!

Global Money Technology \u00b6 Money is the technology that makes known the ever-changing perspectives of value of every human being on earth. Additionally, money must store value over time, and must be transmissible over large distances, anywhere that humans wish to transact. There has never been a true global money, that is, a money that everyone on the globe agrees on as their unit of account , medium of exchange , and as their store of value . Such a technology has never existed, especially because a global money must be properly decentralized and uncensorable. Importantly, whoever controls monetary technology would have power over everyone wishing to transact with that money. A global money could only be possible if no one controlled it. As such, Bitcoin can only be true if no one can control it, or limit who can use it. This means attempts to ban it must fail, as well as attempts to subvert or control its monetary policy. Gold and Silver \u00b6 The closest to a global money was gold and silver. One could travel with gold, and use it in most places, provided it was not seized or stolen. A kingdom would fall, but if their coins were in gold, the monetary value of that gold was transmittable elsewhere. Wars were fought over gold, and if you managed to hold onto your gold over time, it would hold its value. Nations rose and fell, civilization rose and fell, and gold held its value. Unfortunately, gold cannot be transmitted quickly or cheaply over large distances. This limitation gives rise to an inevitable system of credits and ledgers, promisory notes, leading to the system we have today. Petrodollar \u00b6 Today, the world operates on a quasi-global currency known as the USD, or more aptly, the petrodollar . It began in 1971 , supplanting all remnants of the gold standard, and is the most advanced monetary technology to have ever existed, up until Bitcoin. For all its faults, the petrodollar is why you can freely exchange your USD to Canadian dollars or Euros or Yen or Yuan. Almost anywhere on earth you go, you can probably find an ATM that will allow you to withdraw the local currency (at an exchange rate that benefits both banks). Despite the many problems of fiat money, this technology was itself revolutionary, allowing decades of economic growth on a global scale. The dirty secret was that this growth hid the seigniorage of central bankers that has inadvertantly bankrupted every country on earth, transforming stockpiles of wealth into an unsustainable mountain of debt that cannot be contained. This system depends on two critical elements, US military dominance US relations with Saudi Arabia In other words, if Saudi Arabia should fall, the USD would collapse overnight. Similarly, if the US military was not the de-facto dominant power on earth, then the USD would collapse. Likewise, if the US government was to collapse, so too would the petrodollar. This is what it means to be the global reserve currency .

Is a Fixed Supply Important? \u00b6 Let's consider this classic chart that you may have seen in various corners of the Internet. I've seen many versions of this chart, and always felt there was a lot overlooked. Yes, it's a textbook example of currency hyperinflation, but let's dig a little deeper. We can find the raw Weimar Inflation Data online, and using this we can plot the classic hyperbolic price of gold. Additionally, we can track things like the all time high (ATH) and changes to that ATH. For example, There are two stories here. We know the story of the gold price . Inflationary paper money will inevitably end this way. However, there's another story that is often overlooked. There was extreme volatility in the price of gold, as well as in real estate and other hard assets. For well over a year the price was dropping, crashing to less than 50% of its ATH. And then every time there was a new ATH, it was followed for months on end of a painful bear market. And then the process would repeat. The frequency of these painful cycles increased, as did the volatility. The people of German in 1921 lacked the benefit of hindsight that we have looking at this classic story of a currency collapse. Instead, they lived through massive uncertainty, holding gold through periods where it seemed to be losing value. And then other periods where the number would go up and up, only to crash once again -- until finally, the mark itself crashed, hyperinflated into oblivion. A fixed supply is not only important, but critical. And as all fiat currencies have demonstrated, inflation is impossible to avoid. In the early days it can be tamed and even reduced, but eventually it grows along with all the consequent problems of fiat money. Is a Fixed Supply Feasible? \u00b6 A fixed supply is not possible through wishful thinking or central planning. These attempts have all failed, and continue to fail. Gold and silver were more successful as money than other metals simply because their supply was more limited. And yet, the inflation rate of gold (the increase in supply) has historically hovered around 2%. That means every year there is 2% more gold than the previous year. A gold standard means 2% annual inflation. How is it Possible? \u00b6 Many Bitcoiners will tell you to read the code . And yes, the code at the moment will fix the supply at 21 million. GetBlockSubsidy Every 210,000 blocks (roughly every 4 years) the block subsidy (new Bitcoin mined) is reduced in half, and it started at 50.

I've seen many versions of this chart, and always felt there was a lot overlooked. Yes, it's a textbook example of currency hyperinflation, but let's dig a little deeper. We can find the raw Weimar Inflation Data online, and using this we can plot the classic hyperbolic price of gold. Additionally, we can track things like the all time high (ATH) and changes to that ATH. For example, There are two stories here. We know the story of the gold price . Inflationary paper money will inevitably end this way. However, there's another story that is often overlooked. There was extreme volatility in the price of gold, as well as in real estate and other hard assets. For well over a year the price was dropping, crashing to less than 50% of its ATH. And then every time there was a new ATH, it was followed for months on end of a painful bear market. And then the process would repeat. The frequency of these painful cycles increased, as did the volatility. The people of German in 1921 lacked the benefit of hindsight that we have looking at this classic story of a currency collapse. Instead, they lived through massive uncertainty, holding gold through periods where it seemed to be losing value. And then other periods where the number would go up and up, only to crash once again -- until finally, the mark itself crashed, hyperinflated into oblivion. A fixed supply is not only important, but critical. And as all fiat currencies have demonstrated, inflation is impossible to avoid. In the early days it can be tamed and even reduced, but eventually it grows along with all the consequent problems of fiat money.","title":"Is a Fixed Supply Important?"},{"location":"bitcoin-as-money/fixed-supply/#is-a-fixed-supply-feasible","text":"A fixed supply is not possible through wishful thinking or central planning.

Buying a pizza or a coffee, selling a car, all are examples of using money as a medium of exchange. This is an important area where Bitcoin has both a distinct advantage and a perceived disadvantage compared to traditional forms of currency such as gold and silver coins. As a digital money, Bitcoin is extremely advantageous in that it can be transacted anywhere on earth in any arbitrary amount. You don't need to look for exact change, and you don't need to mail a check. With Bitcoin you send a transaction and wait for final settlement. And because Bitcoin is fully decentralized and trustless, this poses a significant disadvantage; you must wait for new blocks in order to reach final settlement. This wait plus transaction fees makes Bitcoin seemingly impractical for buying a cup of coffee. This is why Bitcoin offers a layered architecture, where final settlement is guaranteed on the base layer, and payment networks such as the Lightning network are built on top of the base layer. You put your Bitcoin into a lightning channel, and can use that to buy coffee or pizza in a fast and highly scalable payment network. Think of this as petty cash, like spending from a gift card, only faster and with verifiable payments. Meanwhile the base layer is used only for final settlement. And yet Lightning offers its own verifiable settlements. It can do this because it is built on the Bitcoin network as a 2nd layer, gaining the security and stability of the base layer. Every Bitcoin on the Lightning network is backed by transactions on the base layer. The movement of Bitcoin on the Lightning network simply shifts the balance between owners. E.g., if you start with 0.5 Bitcoin on the Lightning network and spend 0.1, and separately someone pays you 0.05, then your balance of 0.45 Bitcoin can be closed out onto the base layer. Closing a Lightning channel requires a base layer transaction. In fact, if you have an open Lightning channel, you have a guaranteed transaction that could be made on the base layer to close that channel. That guaranteed base-layer transaction is why lightning payments can settle instantly. You start with a guaranteed 0.5 Bitcoin, and when you spend 0.1, your original \"guaranteed 0.5 Bitcoin\" transaction is replaced by one with 0.4 Bitcoin. Lightning network is merely keeping track of the guaranteed transactions that could be made on the base layer. So while base-layer settlement is slow, waiting for 3 or more confirmed blocks, Lightning settlement is instant, and that instant settlement is backed by the guaranteed transaction that could be made on the base-layer. In practice, the Bitcoin in the Lightning network, that is, the amount of Bitcoin in all Lightning channels, represents the circulating supply of Bitcoin as a currency, as a medium of exchange. And importantly, despite the limitations on the base-layer, Lightning transactions are infinitely scalable, easily handling millions or even billions of transactions per second. Lightning demonstrates the importance of a layered architecture as well as the importance of Bitcoin's continuous development. Before there was Lightning, Bitcoin was simply not a viable medium of exchange.

But with Bitcoin, use of force is far less effective. You can transfer your Bitcoin anywhere in the world. And in the extreme, you can take your Bitcoin to the grave.

If they're particularly clever they can buy more Bitcoin with that loan, and if they're devious they'll create fractional reserve schemes. And if they go bankrupt do you really think you'll get \"your\" Bitcoin back? An institution with \"your\" Bitcoin can lock you out of your account.

It's Easy \u00b6 There's a common misconception that Bitcoin Self Custody is hard. In practice, Self Custody is as easy as changing a light-bulb, and it is vastly easier than online banking, not to mention far more secure. Bitcoin is as secure as you want it to be, from trivial to nuclear-launch-code level of security. Bitcoin is hard? Compared to what?! Let's look at the security setup for accessing a typical online banking service, and determine how easy and secure things really are. Typical Online Banking The bank requires a \"strong password\", the kind recommended by security experts. You use a Password Manager to generate \"strong passwords\", and your online banking password is something like CH\"sgK9'?f<WZWYS . The bank requires multi-factor authentication (MFA), and you've been told by security experts not to rely on SMS text messages for MFA, so you install an IdP app, which requires its own password with optional biometric verification. You generate another \"strong password\" for your IdP app, this one is DVqt*\\Hax2$YD5vK . The bank asks for your email address and asks you to verify it. You realize your email can be used to reset passwords, and fortunately you've already enabled MFA for your email service and used a \"strong password\", which is c9~%C8UMNp+ung9= . The bank also requires AML/KYC, so you provide them copies of your passport and you upload an image of yourself holding your passport along with a piece of paper that has your written signature and today's date. You feel stupid sending your bank a selfie, but you do it anyway. The bank also asks you to select and answer three \"security questions\", and you go with your high-school mascot, name of your first pet, and the city you met your significant other ( Cherokees, Rex, Hoboken ). The password manager also requires its own \"strong password\" and in case you forget that one, they provide you a \"secret key\" that they recommend you print out and keep someplace safe. This \"secret key\" they tell you, can be used to recover all of your passwords, so you have to keep it very safe. You write down the following on a piece of paper, 6QRDjV7MmznW63yjZWM5c8ngC5rxQhZxAPXrzfuYbg8CZuLT and you put that paper in a fire-proof lockbox. We could keep going with this all-too-common tale of security theater (and you've no doubt already experienced much of this), but let's pause here and analyze how easy and how secure this system really is -- Security Review In practice, your personal information has certainly been leaked out to the dark web multiple times (through any one of the high-profile data breaches that you read about in the news). The fire-proof lockbox would not preserve a piece of paper through a house fire. Regardless, there's a much bigger problem -- a barely competent hacker could call your bank and impersonate you. With a quick glance at your social media, they can answer the security questions ( Cherokees, Rex, Hoboken ), then they reset the password, change the security questions, liquidate the account, and finally they close the account. If this happens, you'll find yourself locked out of your own account, and after weeks of calling the bank and getting a lawyer involved you will eventually learn what happened. Your account was liquidated. The bank assumes no responsibility, and they give you the number for the FBI. They blame the whole ordeal on your weak security questions and point to the terms and services that you signed (but never read). In case it's not obvious, online banking is vastly more complicated than anything you'll encounter with Bitcoin. And you'll find all the same cryptographic concepts, such as private keys and recovery seeds , but the bank and apps will apply them in comically useless ways that add no real security and still manage to leave you vulnerable. No reasonable person would conclude that the current state of online security is easy. Securing your identity across disparate technology and banking providers is not easy. And worse, it is getting harder and harder by the day. But is Self Custody really as easy as changing a light-bulb? Yes, and definitely easier than the security theater of online banking. Bitcoin is new and can seem complicated. But imagine asking a person from the middle ages to change a light bulb. They'd be confused and without explicit instructions they would probably electrocute themselves. Bitcoin is no different. Future generations may laugh at us for being so hopelessly ignorant of what will seem obvious and intuitive to them. Really, It's Easy \u00b6 Securing your assets in the traditional fiat banking system requires a Rube-Goldberg-Machine of security-theater where telling a call-center operator in the Philipines what your mother's maiden name is somehow constitutes security. Bitcoin Self Custody offers real security. And thus the risk of losing your funds in traditional banking is far higher than any reasonable Self Custody solution. Sounds like banking. Why would I want to be a bank? You don't, and that's the point. Bitcoin allows superior custody services that no bank or institution will ever be able to match.

It is unlike any technology or network. There's really nothing in history quite like it. Bitcoin is unlike anything that has ever existed. This means that any attempt at explaining Bitcoin will rely either on sloppy metaphors, or novel technical terms. Even the term \"custody\" is a bit of a misnomer, an anachronism from a simpler time when banks would \"custody\" your wealth (for a fee). In reality, there are no actual coins to custody. Bitcoin is pure information. Information copied publicly in an immutable ledger. Everyone can have a copy of the ledger, and everyone can validate that the ledger is correct. And similar to how the Internet empowered individuals to share ideas with the world (for better or worse), Bitcoin empowers individuals to custody their wealth in ways far more secure than any bank ever could. And because Bitcoin is money, there are many traditional metaphors (such as wallets, coins, and addresses), that can be useful but at the same time may lead to a great deal of confusion. Bitcoin is in a category all to its own -- the physical limitations of \"custody\", \"wallets\", \"coins\", and \"addresses\" simply don't apply to Bitcoin. And thus to \"custody\" your Bitcoin, means something very different than anything you've thought about before Bitcoin. We will describe these imperfect metaphors and attempt to demystify them, and then discuss the more accurate technical concepts necessary for understanding the truth of Bitcoin and what it really means to custody your Bitcoin . Wallets \u00b6 In Bitcoin, the word \"wallet\" is a misnomer, possibly the most confusing concept in Bitcoin if you're thinking in terms of a physical wallet. The term \"wallet\" in Bitcoin can mean different things. It can refer to a collection of private keys, or invoice addresses, or UTXO sets, or as the hardware or software to manage any of the above. But a Bitcoin wallet is most certainly NOT a collection of your Bitcoin. There is no Bitcoin stored in a Bitcoin wallet. The traditional meaning of the word \"wallet\" simply doesn't apply to Bitcoin. The word \"wallet\" was used in Bitcoin because the original Bitcoin core client app would store private keys in a file named wallet.dat . This \"wallet\" was simply the file where your private keys were stored. Hot Wallet \u00b6 A \"hot wallet\" refers to any software or hardware that stores your private keys in a device connected to the Internet, allowing you to send and receive Bitcoin. If a private key is directly accessible to an online device, this makes it \"hot\". E.g., if you have a Bitcoin wallet app on your phone that can send and receive Bitcoin, this is referred to as a \"hot wallet\". Cold Storage Wallet \u00b6 If you don't store your private key in a device connected to the Internet, this is referred to as \"cold storage\". There are obvious security benefits to cold storage. And \"cold storage\" is the recommended approach for safe custody of your Bitcoin. There are many cold storage practices, and they follow this standard pattern, private keys are stored offline (e.g., in an air-gapped device). public keys (e.g., a Master Public Key) are stored in an Internet-connected device. for receiving Bitcoin, the \"Master Public Key\" can generate receive addresses, and verify transactions. for sending Bitcoin, the \"Master Public Key\" can generate an unsigned transaction , then the unsigned transaction is transfered to the air-gapped device, then the transaction is signed on the air-gapped device, then the signed transaction is transfered to an Internet-connected device, and then broadcast to the network. There are many variations of cold storage but they all adhere to the above pattern; sometimes with additional steps meant to increase security. E.g., using a seed signer, a private key is never stored in any electronic device, air-gapped or otherwise. Instead the key is generated from the seed phrase and used on a signing device only when needed (and discarded immediately afterwards). Wallets Demystified \u00b6 ... Addresses \u00b6 A Bitcoin \"address\", like a \"wallet\", is a misnomer, and when not understood properly can lead to bad outcomes, including lost Bitcoin. In practice, a Bitcoin key can generate unlimited receive addresses. And a given receive address should never be used more than once. A private key is needed to spend any Bitcoin received at these addresses, and a public key can generate receive addresses but not spend. This seems simple enough, however, the word \"address\" implies your Bitcoin is located at this address. In reality, there is no \"address\" where your Bitcoin is located. There is only transactions, which have inputs and outputs, and the outputs can be spent only once. Transaction inputs are created from the unspent outputs of a previous transaction. And the ouputs are created using an address, which is just a number generated by a key. This makes the unspent transaction outputs spendable only by the corresponding private key associated with the address. A Simple Example \u00b6 Imagine you receive 0.5 Bitcoin to an address in your wallet. This will create a transaction that looks something like, flowchart LR subgraph TX-1 direction LR subgraph in-1[in] direction LR a[0.5 BTC] end subgraph out-1[out] direction LR b[0.5 BTC] end end a --> b Then you send 0.1 Bitcoin to someone else (to an invoice address they sent you). It is tempting to think your original address now has 0.4 Bitcoin, but in reality your original address has nothing. The original transaction is spent . When you send the 0.1 Bitcoin, this will create a new transaction with two outputs: flowchart LR subgraph TX-1 direction RL subgraph in-1[in] direction RL a[0.5 BTC] end subgraph out-1[out] direction RL b[0.5 BTC] end end subgraph TX-2 direction TB subgraph in-2[in] direction RL c[0.5 BTC] end subgraph out-2[out] direction BT d[0.1 BTC] end subgraph out-2a[out] direction BT e[0.4 BTC] end end a --> b in-2 --> out-2 in-2 --> out-2a b --> in-2 One output has 0.1 Bitcoin , and another with 0.4 Bitcoin . Your private key can access the output with 0.4 Bitcoin , and someone else has the private key to access the output with 0.1 Bitcoin . The original transaction output of 0.5 Bitcoin is already spent, and the Bitcoin is only available in the new unspent transaction outputs . These unspent transaction ouputs are known as UTXOs (see below). Addresses Demystified \u00b6 An invoice address (aka receive address ), is a number generated by your key that will produce a transaction output that can only be spent by the associated private key. An address is not a location where Bitcoin is stored, but rather is used to generate a transaction output (see UTXOs below). Imperfect Metaphors \u00b6 The words \"wallet\" and \"address\" are at best imperfect metaphors, and at worst confusing anachronisms, like trying to define the Internet in terms of typewriters and postage stamps. However, if you learn how Bitcoin Keys and UTXOs work, then you will understand what people mean when they talk about their Bitcoin wallet and addresses. In fact, by understanding these concepts, you can discover novel ways to custody your own Bitcoin -- and secure your own Bitcoin in ways no bank or custody service could ever match. ... https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Invoice_address Yet proper custody requires a true understanding of Bitcoin, how it works, and the novel ways you can custody your own Bitcoin. Keys \u00b6 It is your Bitcoin keys that you custody. Specifically, you custody your private keys, usually by storing the seed phrases that can be used to generate your private keys. This is the most important aspect of Bitcoin custody. In fact, your Bitcoin is only truly yours to the extent that you have secured your keys in a proper self custody system. Not your keys, not your Bitcoin! A private key is nothing more than a very large number, i.e., a 256-bit number. A private key can be generated from a seed phrase. A seed phrase can generate public and private key pairs. This process is defined in BIP 32, known as Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets Deterministic Wallets \u00b6 https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Deterministic_wallet BIP 32 seed is the entropy used to generate some other desired result.

It is unlike any technology or network. There's really nothing in history quite like it. Bitcoin is unlike anything that has ever existed. This means that any attempt at explaining Bitcoin will rely either on sloppy metaphors, or novel technical terms. Even the term \"custody\" is a bit of a misnomer, an anachronism from a simpler time when banks would \"custody\" your wealth (for a fee). In reality, there are no actual coins to custody. Bitcoin is pure information. Information copied publicly in an immutable ledger. Everyone can have a copy of the ledger, and everyone can validate that the ledger is correct. And similar to how the Internet empowered individuals to share ideas with the world (for better or worse), Bitcoin empowers individuals to custody their wealth in ways far more secure than any bank ever could. And because Bitcoin is money, there are many traditional metaphors (such as wallets, coins, and addresses), that can be useful but at the same time may lead to a great deal of confusion. Bitcoin is in a category all to its own -- the physical limitations of \"custody\", \"wallets\", \"coins\", and \"addresses\" simply don't apply to Bitcoin. And thus to \"custody\" your Bitcoin, means something very different than anything you've thought about before Bitcoin. We will describe these imperfect metaphors and attempt to demystify them, and then discuss the more accurate technical concepts necessary for understanding the truth of Bitcoin and what it really means to custody your Bitcoin .","title":"Wallets and Keys and UTXOs"},{"location":"custody/wallets-and-keys/#wallets","text":"In Bitcoin, the word \"wallet\" is a misnomer, possibly the most confusing concept in Bitcoin if you're thinking in terms of a physical wallet. The term \"wallet\" in Bitcoin can mean different things. It can refer to a collection of private keys, or invoice addresses, or UTXO sets, or as the hardware or software to manage any of the above. But a Bitcoin wallet is most certainly NOT a collection of your Bitcoin. There is no Bitcoin stored in a Bitcoin wallet. The traditional meaning of the word \"wallet\" simply doesn't apply to Bitcoin. The word \"wallet\" was used in Bitcoin because the original Bitcoin core client app would store private keys in a file named wallet.dat . This \"wallet\" was simply the file where your private keys were stored.","title":"Wallets"},{"location":"custody/wallets-and-keys/#hot-wallet","text":"A \"hot wallet\" refers to any software or hardware that stores your private keys in a device connected to the Internet, allowing you to send and receive Bitcoin.

There are obvious security benefits to cold storage. And \"cold storage\" is the recommended approach for safe custody of your Bitcoin. There are many cold storage practices, and they follow this standard pattern, private keys are stored offline (e.g., in an air-gapped device). public keys (e.g., a Master Public Key) are stored in an Internet-connected device. for receiving Bitcoin, the \"Master Public Key\" can generate receive addresses, and verify transactions. for sending Bitcoin, the \"Master Public Key\" can generate an unsigned transaction , then the unsigned transaction is transfered to the air-gapped device, then the transaction is signed on the air-gapped device, then the signed transaction is transfered to an Internet-connected device, and then broadcast to the network. There are many variations of cold storage but they all adhere to the above pattern; sometimes with additional steps meant to increase security. E.g., using a seed signer, a private key is never stored in any electronic device, air-gapped or otherwise. Instead the key is generated from the seed phrase and used on a signing device only when needed (and discarded immediately afterwards).","title":"Cold Storage Wallet"},{"location":"custody/wallets-and-keys/#wallets-demystified","text":"...","title":"Wallets Demystified"},{"location":"custody/wallets-and-keys/#addresses","text":"A Bitcoin \"address\", like a \"wallet\", is a misnomer, and when not understood properly can lead to bad outcomes, including lost Bitcoin. In practice, a Bitcoin key can generate unlimited receive addresses. And a given receive address should never be used more than once. A private key is needed to spend any Bitcoin received at these addresses, and a public key can generate receive addresses but not spend. This seems simple enough, however, the word \"address\" implies your Bitcoin is located at this address. In reality, there is no \"address\" where your Bitcoin is located. There is only transactions, which have inputs and outputs, and the outputs can be spent only once. Transaction inputs are created from the unspent outputs of a previous transaction. And the ouputs are created using an address, which is just a number generated by a key.

You will need to transfer the seed phrase to a secure airgapped computer and generate a checksum, however everything before that can be done by hand. I recommend using 8-sided dice that have been verified through a saltwater balance test . This will make the mapping much easier because an 8-sided dice corresponds exactly to 3-bits of entropy. Use the following chart to map each number to its binary equivalient. 8D dice roll 3-bits 1 001 2 010 3 011 4 100 5 101 6 110 7 111 8 000 Each number on the dice corresponds directly to its binary representation, except 8, which in binary is \"1000\" and so this is just the lower 3-bits of 8 in binary. Because an 8-sided dice maps perfectly into 3-bits, it is very easy to roll and record the entropy bits directly in binary. Write Dice Rolls in Binary \u00b6 Each word in the seed phrase is exactly 11-bits (2048 possibilities). And each dice roll will provide 3-bits. You'll want to keep rolling until you fill out all but the last 11-bit word, and 3-bits of the 24th word. As you fill out 3-bits at a time, you can go left-to-right and top-down, and stop after writing 3-bits into the 24th word. The remaining 8-bits of the final word are calculated through a checksum which we'll discuss next. What about 12-Word Seeds? You could also do 12-word seeds, which will give you 128-bits of entropy. You'll fill out 11 of the 11-bit words and 7-bits of the 12th word. The remaining 4-bits will be the checksum. In either case, you'll need to compute the checksum to arrive at a valid final word. This simple checksum is to ensure that you've got a valid seed phrase. A common approach is to add an additional passphrase to the seed words, like a 13th or 25th word, but not constrained to the BIP-39 word list. This passphrase can provide additional bits of entropy, and using a strong passphrase can easily add enough entropy to make a 12-word plus passphrase seed as strong as a 24-word seed. Complete the Checksum \u00b6 Completing the final word requires a checksum. In this case a sha256sum of the 256-bits of entropy. Remember the 24th word has 8-bits for the checksum, which should be the first 8-bits of the shasum. This may sound complicated, but you can use the same secure airgapped computer you plan on using to sign transactions and Self Custody your Bitcoin.

Each hexidecimal digit is exactly 4-bits, and b is 1011 , so bb is 10111011 If you are not sure how to convert hexidecimal digits to binary, or you want to verify you did it correctly, you can verify in python, >>> format ( int ( \"bb\" , 16 ), \"08b\" ) '10111011' >>> Once you have the first 8 binary digits of the shasum, simply add those 8-bits to the worksheet to complete your 24th word.

Seed Word Lookup \u00b6 Now that you have all the binary values, you can resolve each of the 24 values to its corresponding BIP-39 seed word . There are many ways to do this, and a helpful place to start is to reference a printable version of the BIP-39 words.

Securing Keys Using Keys","title":"Verify Seed Phrase"},{"location":"custody/creating-keys/dice/","text":"Using Dice \u00b6 You can (and should) generate seed phrases with dice. This is because true randomness is surprisingly difficult to achieve on a computer. This is referred to as entropy , that is, a measure of randomness. For example, a fair coin flip is 1-bit of entropy; flipping two coins can offer 2-bits of entropy (4 possible outcomes). But if one of the coins is unfair and always lands on heads, then we're back to only 1-bit of entropy from the first coin. The goal of a seed phrase is to achieve the maximimum amount of entropy that would prevent anyone from deriving or guessing your seed phrase. Beware of Low Entropy A 24-word seed phrase is nothing more than an encoding of a 256-bit number (with a checksum at the end). If all 256-bits were the same, that is, all zeros except the checksum, then this would have very low entropy. The seed phrase would simply be, abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon art That's 23 abandon 's and 1 art Turns out this ridiculous 1-bit of entropy phrase was actually used before. You can recover this wallet and view the transaction history for yourself. For 2-hours in 2016 there was 346.9341 Bitcoin stored with this key. Perhaps it's part of a Steganographic puzzle, and this is the first entry into finding a hidden fortune. Or perhaps someone didn't know what they were doing and lost all their Bitcoin. How to get High Entropy? In the above example, it took less than a second to discover a seed phrase protected only by 1-bit of entropy. How long would it take for 256-bits of entropy? 256-bits of entropy is difficult to fathom. You might hear \"centuries\" or \"millions of years\", but it's more like, \"beyond the age of the universe even with planet-sized super-computers powered by Dyson-spheres around every star.\" It's the same as flipping a coin 256 times. Not exactly a difficult task, but assuming it was a fair coin then this would get you 256-bits of entropy, and the odds of anyone guessing or deriving that exact 256-bit number is impossible (unless they watched you flipping the coin). It's like finding a needle in a haystack -- if the haystack was the entire universe, and also the needle was invisible. Numeric Base of Dice \u00b6 We usually deal with Base-10 (decimal) and Base-2 (binary). In fact, when we say \"bits\" we're referring to the length of a binary number. But we can represent a number in any arbitrary base. And this is important because one of the best sources of true random numbers is fair dice rolls. A common 6-sided dice can be used to generate a 256-bit number, but doing so can be somewhat confusing. You may try to map the numbers to binary but you'll find it's not so easy (1 dice gives you 2.5-bits of entropy). To be safe you could just map odd and even rolls to binary 1 and 0, but this requires 256 dice rolls and isn't very efficient. A better aproach is to use a Base-6 representation of a 256-bit number, which would require 100 dice rolls. This is the number of fair dice rolls necessary to achieve 256-bits of entropy. Alternatively, and my recommendation, is to use an 8-sided dice, the kind commonly found in role-playing games. A fair 8-sided dice roll has exactly 3-bits of entropy (meaning every 8-sided dice roll gives you exactly 3 of the desired 256-bits). With this approach you'll need 86 rolls to generate sufficient entropy for a seed phrase. 256-bits in other Bases \u00b6 Numeric Base length Description Base-2 (binary) 256 coin tosses Base-6 100 dice rolls Base-8 (octal) 86 8-sided dice rolls Base-10 (decimal) 78 770-Quattuorvigintillion Base-20 60 20-sided dice rolls Base-64 43 I-Ching Hexagrams Base-2048 24 seed words How to Ensure Fair Dice \u00b6 There's a strange phenomenon in the Bitcoin community where they insist on casino-grade dice; as if \"casino\" is an infallible authority on dice grading that we should trust our life savings with. Don't trust, verify If you're concerned with the fairness of dice, then you should verify your dice with a saltwater balance test . Whether using \"AAA casino-grade razor-edge precision dice\" or using the dice you got from a board game, a saltwater test can verify if the dice is balanced or not. Just saying \"Casino-grade\" is not a verification. In most cases, even a slightly unbalanced dice will still roll fairly, but it's recommended to verify that a given set of dice (casino-grade or otherwise) is balanced so you'll know it can generate the desired level of entropy. Saltwater Balance Test \u00b6 You'll find many examples online , mostly from dedicated communities around board games, RPGs, and gambling aficionados. God bless our fellow nerds.

No trust required!","title":"Using Dice"},{"location":"custody/creating-keys/dice/#using-dice","text":"You can (and should) generate seed phrases with dice. This is because true randomness is surprisingly difficult to achieve on a computer. This is referred to as entropy , that is, a measure of randomness. For example, a fair coin flip is 1-bit of entropy; flipping two coins can offer 2-bits of entropy (4 possible outcomes). But if one of the coins is unfair and always lands on heads, then we're back to only 1-bit of entropy from the first coin. The goal of a seed phrase is to achieve the maximimum amount of entropy that would prevent anyone from deriving or guessing your seed phrase. Beware of Low Entropy A 24-word seed phrase is nothing more than an encoding of a 256-bit number (with a checksum at the end). If all 256-bits were the same, that is, all zeros except the checksum, then this would have very low entropy. The seed phrase would simply be, abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon art That's 23 abandon 's and 1 art Turns out this ridiculous 1-bit of entropy phrase was actually used before. You can recover this wallet and view the transaction history for yourself. For 2-hours in 2016 there was 346.9341 Bitcoin stored with this key. Perhaps it's part of a Steganographic puzzle, and this is the first entry into finding a hidden fortune. Or perhaps someone didn't know what they were doing and lost all their Bitcoin. How to get High Entropy? In the above example, it took less than a second to discover a seed phrase protected only by 1-bit of entropy. How long would it take for 256-bits of entropy? 256-bits of entropy is difficult to fathom. You might hear \"centuries\" or \"millions of years\", but it's more like, \"beyond the age of the universe even with planet-sized super-computers powered by Dyson-spheres around every star.\" It's the same as flipping a coin 256 times. Not exactly a difficult task, but assuming it was a fair coin then this would get you 256-bits of entropy, and the odds of anyone guessing or deriving that exact 256-bit number is impossible (unless they watched you flipping the coin). It's like finding a needle in a haystack -- if the haystack was the entire universe, and also the needle was invisible.","title":"Using Dice"},{"location":"custody/creating-keys/dice/#numeric-base-of-dice","text":"We usually deal with Base-10 (decimal) and Base-2 (binary). In fact, when we say \"bits\" we're referring to the length of a binary number. But we can represent a number in any arbitrary base. And this is important because one of the best sources of true random numbers is fair dice rolls. A common 6-sided dice can be used to generate a 256-bit number, but doing so can be somewhat confusing. You may try to map the numbers to binary but you'll find it's not so easy (1 dice gives you 2.5-bits of entropy). To be safe you could just map odd and even rolls to binary 1 and 0, but this requires 256 dice rolls and isn't very efficient. A better aproach is to use a Base-6 representation of a 256-bit number, which would require 100 dice rolls. This is the number of fair dice rolls necessary to achieve 256-bits of entropy. Alternatively, and my recommendation, is to use an 8-sided dice, the kind commonly found in role-playing games. A fair 8-sided dice roll has exactly 3-bits of entropy (meaning every 8-sided dice roll gives you exactly 3 of the desired 256-bits). With this approach you'll need 86 rolls to generate sufficient entropy for a seed phrase.","title":"Numeric Base of Dice"},{"location":"custody/creating-keys/dice/#256-bits-in-other-bases","text":"Numeric Base length Description Base-2 (binary) 256 coin tosses Base-6 100 dice rolls Base-8 (octal) 86 8-sided dice rolls Base-10 (decimal) 78 770-Quattuorvigintillion Base-20 60 20-sided dice rolls Base-64 43 I-Ching Hexagrams Base-2048 24 seed words","title":"256-bits in other Bases"},{"location":"custody/creating-keys/dice/#how-to-ensure-fair-dice","text":"There's a strange phenomenon in the Bitcoin community where they insist on casino-grade dice; as if \"casino\" is an infallible authority on dice grading that we should trust our life savings with.

Whether using \"AAA casino-grade razor-edge precision dice\" or using the dice you got from a board game, a saltwater test can verify if the dice is balanced or not. Just saying \"Casino-grade\" is not a verification.
