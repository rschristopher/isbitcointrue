Christopher","title":"Is Bitcoin True?"},{"location":"is-bitcoin-true/","text":"Is Bitcoin True? \u00b6 One of my earliest reactions to a deep dive into Bitcoin, was the thought, It also fixes modern art? This is too good to be true. Politics and War Food and Health Education and Research Science and Innovation All of this has become broken, deeply broken, by fiat money, specifically monetary inflation. Bitcoin aims to fix this; to do what gold failed to do. Can it? All it would have to do is work. A truly scarce and yet infinitely divisible money. If it worked, then by its very nature it would obsolete fiat money and forever end monetary inflation, thereby \"fixing\" the intractable problems caused by fiat. For this to be true, it needs to be scarce, transmittable in any divisible amount. The latter is trivial, the ability of any digital money. But is it truly scarce? A centralized currency could be scarce. The USD technically could be scarce, but in practice it's not. For a centralized currency to be truly scarce it would need an incorruptible administration, something everyone could trust. One could imagine a sufficiently advanced intelligence, superhuman aliens, that create a secure centralized ledger that every human being can access, and that it's all based on a known finite amount. So many Questions \u00b6 Why scarcity? Why not inflation? Why 21 million? Why a ledger? Why NOT a token? Why mining? Why proof of work? Why every ten minutes? Why every four years? Why not longer? Why not shorter? Why sha256? Why not a larger block size? Why lightning? Why not \"crypto\"? Why not NFTs? Bitcoin Maximalism \u00b6 Bitcoin maximalism is the consequence of Bitcoin being true. Of understanding that it does in fact solve the economic problem of fiat money. But does it really? Is Bitcoin True? The consequences of fiat money run through the entirety of civilization, leaving almost nothing untouched, so are the effects of fiat money. The power offered by fiat is truly great, yet at a horrible cost. It benefits your present self while simultaneously hurting everyone else, including your own future. It does nothing to increase capital, but to redirect it outside of a free market, an illusion of control, that is, an illusion of power. It is a destabilizing parasitic evil that provides a temporary illusion of power. It prays on the weak and sinful. It gives them the ability to tax without the strength to impose such a tax. Bitcoin redeems, taking our sinful nature that inevitably leads to fiat, and turning into a force of good, defending the network. Miners are gargoyles, and their greed is protecting the sacred, the immutable ledger of a finite money supply. Altcoins? \u00b6 Shitcoins are not even attempting to solve the problem Bitcoin solves. They offer no scarcity. They are free market monies that operate as securities. They offer features because they're digital money, but without scarcity over time. Bitcoin is scarce over time, now and in the future. It will always be scarce, always. This is why the value will always increase with true economic output, savings will thus always be rewarded without the need of interest rates. Just a fixed savings whose value will increase in purchasing power. Meaning the quality of consumer goods will increase sufficiently to meet the demand. What would it have to look like to be true? Supporting Bitcoin means you are supporting a better future, where prosperity and human flourishing increase. The only way to devalue Bitcoin amongst Bitcoin holders is to reduce human flourishing, which by itself is non-sustainable, obviously because then we're talking about the elimination of human civilization. If civilization is to not only persist but to flourish, then Bitcoin wins. If Bitcoin is true, then it wins in the end, redeeming civilization in the process. Inflation \u00b6 Could an ideal money be inflationary? That is, if inflation is truly healthy, let's say, by whatever percent is an ideal annual growth rate of a given economy, then yes, one could increase the block reward such that miners get paid more and not less, incentivizing future investments into mining. But why save? Because your purchasing power will, on average, never change. Prices may still decrease over time due to efficiency improvements as the larger economy grows, but nothing as dramatic as deflationary money like Bitcoin. Relatively stable prices over time would be an obvious advantage, and are the basis of much of MMT. Although in practice, prices increase under fiat, a decentralized alternative currency could potentially avoid those pitfalls. Ironically, the biggest threat to such inflationary money is Bitcoin itself. Why hold an inflationary asset when a scarce one exists? Bitcoin supply is fixed, meaning there is zero possible inflation, ever. The smart money will find its way to the hardest asset. The only way to do better is deflationary currency, money whose supply can shrink and never be recovered. So rather than 21.million, something that slowly decreases, say, to 18.million, and so on. But it can't be random or a source of centralization, no one would store wealth in something that might disappear for reasons that could never have been adequately prevented. And the total supply can't disappear, but the total supply could be reduced without end, so long as the remaining supply is infinitely divisible. That is, if only 1 Bitcoin still existed. Or only 1 Satoshi... If, in this hypothetical 1.sat economy, someone discovers keys to an entire Bitcoin. Well, that is now an inflationary event. Increasing the money supply, and at the benefit of those nearest to the new supply. The biggest threat to Bitcoin is not lost keys but rather found keys that were once believed to have been lost. The damages of such an inflationary event are the very damages of fiat itself. The only better version of Bitcoin is one where \"lost\" coins are in fact known to be lost. Such a system would be truly deflationary in a provable way. Perhaps a future BIP will provide means to do so, but such a feat is beyond this author's current understanding. Perhaps a voluntary system where one can prove ownership but also that if keys are ever found, the funds are redistributed evenly across the network. Or a null account that destroys any Bitcoin sent to it? Such ideas have maddeningly difficult consequences and would not altogether solve the lost Bitcoin problem. How do I know it's truly lost? In a trustless system, I don't, not without verifiable proof. This means I will act as if Satoshi's coins are active, that they're part of the active supply, and that at any minute they will be used. In the 1.sat world, it is still operating under the assumption of a fixed 21.million, but only a tiny fraction of the supply is active in the market. The market in such a scenario must safeguard against the introduction of new sats, up to the max. The max is still known. So even in that situation it's better than infinite fiat. But, for this reason, Bitcoin can act as a truly deflationary money, but at a risk of inflationary events anytime \"lost\" coins are \"found\". A hypothetical zero inflation money, always 21.million and nothing ever lost, this would be weaker than Bitcoin, which is guaranteed to be deflationary as coins are lost or even deliberately destroyed. Yet this guarantee comes with a risk of \"found\" keys, that is, sudden increases in the effective money supply, cantillon bubbles that could be destabilizing. Bitcoin's cantillon risk. USD \u00b6 What is the ultimate fate of the USD? The USD used to be backed by gold. Roughly $20/ounce, then $35/ounce, then pure fiat backed by the US empire's agreement with Saudi Arabia. These are, by any measure, distinct monies, but all were known as USD. The fate of the existing post 1971 fiat USD seems obvious, as non-sustainable systems tend to.. well.. not sustain. And we're way past the point of no return. 80% of all circulating money was created in the last two years. True inflation, monetary inflation, is already in hyperinflation, despite a massive cover up and claiming it's all transient and that price inflation is unrelated to the massive monetary inflation. The willful stupidity of modern economists is startling. What is the effect of Bitcoin on USD? Unsure. Let's assume that the existing powers are failing, which seems to be the most likely scenario for their increasingly hysterical and incompetent behavior. Will they take the system down with them? Yes, if they could. Will Bitcoin adoption buoy the supply chains and free market remnants? Yes, it definitely could. The existing hysterical incompetence will try to take the system down with them, demanding unlimited power with no accountability for what any reasonable analysis would conclude as crimes against humanity. But they don't, and never had, real power. They are spokespeople for the masses, voices of the delusions. In the end, people want to eat, feed their families, be healthy, live productive lives that offer a future that is worth their present suffering, oh and of course not needlessly die in a gulag or concentration camp. Freedom is a necessity, and without it systems fail. This includes the current leaders. They can't but live in the world too, and act out their human desire for freedom and flourishing. What made civilization possible was not the systems of control, but freedom to live good lives, freedom and opportunity to build your own life, a life that is worth living. The idea that, \"it works\", is a strange lie when looking at the historical context. CCP? USSR? The best successful examples of controlled systems. They offered no innovation other than to parasitically feed from free market civilizations. An accomplishment that other controlled systems failed to replicate. Yet they repeat this lie. Why? Why repeat the lie? Because it promises power and the elevation of the systems of man as God. Creating ourselves a God. What we create operates within rules, natural laws. Bitcoin fixes this when adoption increases, not when it's USD price increases. Increase adoption of Bitcoin as money. Store of wealth, unit of account, system of exchange, ... Bitcoin's price in USD means very little. How about the relative percentage of total supply? Although by that measure it's a great example of a true inflation hedge. The timescale that shitcoiners operate on seems to be quite small. Such as claims that Bitcoin is not correlated with inflation. This seems absurd especially when you zoom out and see that Bitcoin is resistant to monetary inflation with the price benefitting the larger USD supply, as the additional money eventually finds its way into Bitcoin. And yet, it's so small compared to other assets. The price ultimately affects the demand curve, that's about it. It's benefiting from cantillon insiders buying Bitcoin, but until it finds stronger hands the true benefit may not be achieved. Another 10 years? Maybe! clean this up \u00b6 Year is not over. But it's almost over. Price is 49k, which is less than the 220k or whatever the fuck Max Keiser predicted. And now? What will 2022 have in store for us? There's a definite move towards totalitarian control, towards fear and slavery. Interest rates are up, inflation is soaring, and the price of BTCUSD is 40k... It seems the price is a reflection of the good, the people wishing to see a better future, a future of human flourishing. The getonzero idea is promising, although it's still fiat payment rails. Arguably cash is a better solution for purchases. Read the Code \u00b6 Is Bitcoin True and how can you tell? How can you verify that it is true? The answers are usually to scoff and tell you to read the code. Well, okay, I can competently read code. But that doesn't mean shit. Yes, the code will at the moment be capped at 21.million. But how can I prove that this won't change in the future? One pull request away from a different max? Such a change would be a hard fork, which would break consensus rules, requiring a majority of mining power to agree on the larger supply. And the moment such a thing is possible, then it's now an inflationary money supply that might as well be fiat. You can't on one hand claim this isn't possible due to game theory while on the other saying that the masses don't matter. Let's not forget that the vast majority of the world's population fell into covid hysteria. Inalienable rights seemed to be easily discarded given this mass hysteria, why would monetary policy be different? As with covid, it's clear there exists bad actors that will always be trying to subvert and take power. Bitcoin will be under attack, forever. And they'll naturally play a long game, as with gold or really anything. This force of constant evil is a fact of life. Whether we like it or not, the so-called Bitcoin remnant, the Bitcoiners themselves, are playing a game (game theory after all) to influence and control the masses, to make sure that Bitcoin's fixed supply remains fixed. That there will never be more than 21.million. They are competing with the central bankers and the politicians and all those who pull the strings. Enemies \u00b6 And what if Bitcoin becomes controlled through whitelists? That only approved transactions on approved addresses become allowed, agreements with all major exchanges and miners. It would create a soft fork, and potentially a hard fork. Or rather, liquidity could be so severely impaired that it loses value. But unless this leads to updated consensus rules, the scarcity remains. Without Bitcoin as dark money, this creates a risk of a growing surveillance state, the beast. Store of value holders will carry the value into the future. Liquidity need only be roughly as good or better than the alternative value stores, perhaps real estate. This alone will prop up the value for generations.","title":"The Essay"},{"location":"is-bitcoin-true/#is-bitcoin-true","text":"One of my earliest reactions to a deep dive into Bitcoin, was the thought, It also fixes modern art?

Unlike physical custody of assets, custody of Bitcoin means storing information, a key or seed phrase, and to store it in such a way that no one else would ever be able to know it. For example, consider the following seed phrase, holiday crew machine fatigue welcome start axis cancel field slim rifle hero Because this seed phrase has been revealed, anyone can generate private keys from this seed, which will access any Bitcoin stored in its invoice addresses (generated from this seed). What if you had to secure this seed phrase? In other words, how would you secure this phrase such that, The seed phrase is accessible to those you trust (family members and the like), and No one else could ever know the seed phrase Knowing how to fulfil the above is at the heart of how to custody Bitcoin. Self Custody \u00b6 To Self Custody means you personally secure your seed phrase and manage your own keys. This is the recommended approach but it is also the only way to properly secure your Bitcoin. With Self Custody you could decide that you'd rather die than give up your Bitcoin; that it will go to your children or else to no one. This sounds silly and rather extreme, but Bitcoin is the only asset in the history of the world where you can meaningfully accomplish this level of ownership. And you can accomplish this without lawyers or politicians. In fact, you can accomplish this even in opposition to lawyers and politicians (as well as churches or nation states). Can you say the same about stocks, bonds, real-estate, or any modern financial instrument? The closest you might get is a physical possession, a bearer asset such as gold bullion. But there is an important difference: with the use of force anyone can take possession of gold bullion (as has happened over-and-over throughout history), incentivizing the use of force to seize wealth. But with Bitcoin, use of force is far less effective. You can transfer your Bitcoin anywhere in the world. And in the extreme, you can take your Bitcoin to the grave.

It's Easy \u00b6 There's a common misconception that Bitcoin Self Custody is hard. In practice, Self Custody is as easy as changing a light-bulb, and it is vastly easier than online banking, not to mention far more secure. Bitcoin is as secure as you want it to be, from trivial to nuclear-launch-code level of security. Bitcoin is hard? Compared to what?! Let's look at the security setup for accessing a typical online banking service, and determine how easy and secure things really are. Typical Online Banking The bank requires a \"strong password\", the kind recommended by security experts. You use a Password Manager to generate \"strong passwords\", and your online banking password is something like CH\"sgK9'?f<WZWYS . The bank requires multi-factor authentication (MFA), and you've been told by security experts not to rely on SMS text messages for MFA, so you install an IdP app, which requires its own password with optional biometric verification. You generate another \"strong password\" for your IdP app, this one is DVqt*\\Hax2$YD5vK . The bank asks for your email address and asks you to verify it. You realize your email can be used to reset passwords, and fortunately you've already enabled MFA for your email service and used a \"strong password\", which is c9~%C8UMNp+ung9= . The bank also requires AML/KYC, so you provide them copies of your passport and you upload an image of yourself holding your passport along with a piece of paper that has your written signature and today's date. You feel stupid sending your bank a selfie, but you do it anyway. The bank also asks you to select and answer three \"security questions\", and you go with your high-school mascot, name of your first pet, and the city you met your significant other ( Cherokees, Rex, Hoboken ). The password manager also requires its own \"strong password\" and in case you forget that one, they provide you a \"secret key\" that they recommend you print out and keep someplace safe. This \"secret key\" they tell you, can be used to recover all of your passwords, so you have to keep it very safe. You write down the following on a piece of paper, 6QRDjV7MmznW63yjZWM5c8ngC5rxQhZxAPXrzfuYbg8CZuLT and you put that paper in a fire-proof lockbox. We could keep going with this all-too-common tale of security theater (and you've no doubt already experienced much of this), but let's pause here and analyze how easy and how secure this system really is -- Security Review In practice, your personal information has certainly been leaked out to the dark web multiple times (through any one of the high-profile data breaches that you read about in the news). The fire-proof lockbox would not preserve a piece of paper through a house fire. Regardless, there's a much bigger problem -- a barely competent hacker could call your bank and impersonate you. With a quick glance at your social media, they can answer the security questions ( Cherokees, Rex, Hoboken ), then they reset the password, change the security questions, liquidate the account, and finally they close the account. If this happens, you'll find yourself locked out of your own account, and after weeks of calling the bank and getting a lawyer involved you will eventually learn what happened. Your account was liquidated. The bank assumes no responsibility, and they give you the number for the FBI. They blame the whole ordeal on your weak security questions and point to the terms and services that you signed (but never read). In case it's not obvious, online banking is vastly more complicated than anything you'll encounter with Bitcoin. And you'll find all the same cryptographic concepts, such as private keys and recovery seeds , but the bank and apps will apply them in comically useless ways that add no real security and still manage to leave you vulnerable. No reasonable person would conclude that the current state of online security is easy. Securing your identity across disparate technology and banking providers is not easy. And worse, it is getting harder and harder by the day. But is Self Custody really as easy as changing a light-bulb? Yes, and definitely easier than the security theater of online banking. Bitcoin is new and can seem complicated. But imagine asking a person from the middle ages to change a light bulb. They'd be confused and without explicit instructions they would probably electrocute themselves. Bitcoin is no different. Future generations may laugh at us for being so hopelessly ignorant of what will seem obvious and intuitive to them. Really, It's Easy \u00b6 Securing your assets in the traditional fiat banking system requires a Rube-Goldberg-Machine of security-theater where telling a call-center operator in the Philipines what your mother's maiden name is, somehow constitutes security. Bitcoin Self Custody offers real security. And thus the risk of losing your funds in traditional banking is far higher than any reasonable Self Custody solution. Sounds like banking.

It is unlike any technology or network. There's really nothing in history quite like it. Bitcoin is unlike anything that has ever existed. This means that any attempt at explaining Bitcoin will rely either on sloppy metaphors, or novel technical terms. Even the term \"custody\" is a bit of a misnomer, an anachronism from a simpler time when banks would \"custody\" your wealth (for a fee). In reality, there are no actual coins to custody. Bitcoin is pure information. Information copied publicly in an immutable ledger. Everyone can have a copy of the ledger, and everyone can validate that the ledger is correct. And similar to how the Internet empowered individuals to share ideas with the world (for better or worse), Bitcoin empowers individuals to custody their wealth in ways far more secure than any bank ever could. And because Bitcoin is money, there are many traditional metaphors (such as wallets, coins, and addresses), that can be useful but at the same time may lead to a great deal of confusion. Bitcoin is in a category all to its own -- the physical limitations of \"custody\", \"wallets\", \"coins\", and \"addresses\" simply don't apply to Bitcoin. And thus to \"custody\" your Bitcoin, means something very different than anything you've thought about before Bitcoin. We will describe these imperfect metaphors and attempt to demystify them, and then discuss the more accurate technical concepts necessary for understanding the truth of Bitcoin and what it really means to custody your Bitcoin . Wallets \u00b6 In Bitcoin, the word \"wallet\" is a misnomer, possibly the most confusing concept in Bitcoin if you're thinking in terms of a physical wallet. The term \"wallet\" in Bitcoin can mean different things. It can refer to a collection of private keys, or invoice addresses, or UTXO sets, or as the hardware or software to manage any of the above. But a Bitcoin wallet is most certainly NOT a collection of your Bitcoin. There is no Bitcoin stored in a Bitcoin wallet. The traditional meaning of the word \"wallet\" simply doesn't apply to Bitcoin. The word \"wallet\" was used in Bitcoin because the original Bitcoin core client app would store private keys in a file named wallet.dat . This \"wallet\" was simply the file where your private keys were stored. Hot Wallet \u00b6 A \"hot wallet\" refers to any software or hardware that stores your private keys in a device connected to the Internet, allowing you to send and receive Bitcoin. If a private key is directly accessible to an online device, this makes it \"hot\". E.g., if you have a Bitcoin wallet app on your phone that can send and receive Bitcoin, this is referred to as a \"hot wallet\". Cold Storage Wallet \u00b6 If you don't store your private key in a device connected to the Internet, this is referred to as \"cold storage\". There are obvious security benefits to cold storage. And \"cold storage\" is the recommended approach for safe custody of your Bitcoin. There are many cold storage practices, and they follow this standard pattern, private keys are stored offline (e.g., in an air-gapped device). public keys (e.g., a Master Public Key) are stored in an Internet-connected device. for receiving Bitcoin, the \"Master Public Key\" can generate receive addresses, and verify transactions. for sending Bitcoin, the \"Master Public Key\" can generate an unsigned transaction , then the unsigned transaction is transfered to the air-gapped device, then the transaction is signed on the air-gapped device, then the signed transaction is transfered to an Internet-connected device, and then broadcast to the network. There are many variations of cold storage but they all adhere to the above pattern; sometimes with additional steps meant to increase security. E.g., using a seed signer, a private key is never stored in any electronic device, air-gapped or otherwise. Instead the key is generated from the seed phrase and used on a signing device only when needed (and discarded immediately afterwards). Wallets Demystified \u00b6 ... Addresses \u00b6 A Bitcoin \"address\", like a \"wallet\", is a misnomer, and when not understood properly can lead to bad outcomes, including lost Bitcoin. In practice, a Bitcoin key can generate unlimited receive addresses. And a given receive address should never be used more than once. A private key is needed to spend any Bitcoin received at these addresses, and a public key can generate receive addresses but not spend. This seems simple enough, however, the word \"address\" implies your Bitcoin is located at this address. In reality, there is no \"address\" where your Bitcoin is located. There is only transactions, which have inputs and outputs, and the outputs can be spent only once. Transaction inputs are created from the unspent outputs of a previous transaction. And the ouputs are created using an address, which is just a number generated by a key. This makes the unspent transaction outputs spendable only by the corresponding private key associated with the address. A Simple Example \u00b6 Imagine you receive 0.5 Bitcoin to an address in your wallet. This will create a transaction that looks something like, flowchart LR subgraph TX-1 direction LR subgraph in-1[in] direction LR a[0.5 BTC] end subgraph out-1[out] direction LR b[0.5 BTC] end end a --> b Then you send 0.1 Bitcoin to someone else (to an invoice address they sent you). It is tempting to think your original address now has 0.4 Bitcoin, but in reality your original address has nothing. The original transaction is spent . When you send the 0.1 Bitcoin, this will create a new transaction with two outputs: flowchart LR subgraph TX-1 direction RL subgraph in-1[in] direction RL a[0.5 BTC] end subgraph out-1[out] direction RL b[0.5 BTC] end end subgraph TX-2 direction TB subgraph in-2[in] direction RL c[0.5 BTC] end subgraph out-2[out] direction BT d[0.1 BTC] end subgraph out-2a[out] direction BT e[0.4 BTC] end end a --> b in-2 --> out-2 in-2 --> out-2a b --> in-2 One output has 0.1 Bitcoin , and another with 0.4 Bitcoin . Your private key can access the output with 0.4 Bitcoin , and someone else has the private key to access the output with 0.1 Bitcoin . The original transaction output of 0.5 Bitcoin is already spent, and the Bitcoin is only available in the new unspent transaction outputs . These unspent transaction ouputs are known as UTXOs (see below). Addresses Demystified \u00b6 An invoice address (aka receive address ), is a number generated by your key that will produce a transaction output that can only be spent by the associated private key. An address is not a location where Bitcoin is stored, but rather is used to generate a transaction output (see UTXOs below). Imperfect Metaphors \u00b6 The words \"wallet\" and \"address\" are at best imperfect metaphors, and at worst confusing anachronisms, like trying to define the Internet in terms of typewriters and postage stamps. However, if you learn how Bitcoin Keys and UTXOs work, then you will understand what people mean when they talk about their Bitcoin wallet and addresses. In fact, by understanding these concepts, you can discover novel ways to custody your own Bitcoin -- and secure your own Bitcoin in ways no bank or custody service could ever match. ... https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Invoice_address Yet proper custody requires a true understanding of Bitcoin, how it works, and the novel ways you can custody your own Bitcoin. Keys \u00b6 It is your Bitcoin keys that you custody. Specifically, you custody your private keys, usually by storing the seed phrases that can be used to generate your private keys. This is the most important aspect of Bitcoin custody. In fact, your Bitcoin is only truly yours to the extent that you have secured your keys in a proper self custody system. Not your keys, not your Bitcoin! A private key is nothing more than a very large number, i.e., a 256-bit number. A private key can be generated from a seed phrase. A seed phrase can generate public and private key pairs. This process is defined in BIP 32, known as Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets Deterministic Wallets \u00b6 https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Deterministic_wallet BIP 32 seed is the entropy used to generate some other desired result. It could be used for generating a private key, a master private key, or mnemonic. Seed Phrase (Mnemonic) Master Extended Key Pair Receive Addresses https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Seed_phrase ...

You will need to transfer them to a secure computer and generate a checksum, however everything before that can be done by hand. I recommend using 8-sided dice that have been verified through a saltwater balance test . This will make the mapping much easier because an 8-sided dice corresponds exactly to 3-bits of entropy. Use the following chart to map each number to its binary equivalient. 8D dice roll 3-bits 1 001 2 010 3 011 4 100 5 101 6 110 7 111 8 000 Each number on the dice corresponds directly to its binary representation, except 8, which in binary is \"1000\" and so this is just the lower 3-bits of 8 in binary. Because an 8-sided dice maps perfectly into 3-bits, it is very easy to roll and record the entropy bits directly in binary. Write Dice Rolls in Binary \u00b6 Each word in the seed phrase is exactly 11-bits (2048 possibilities). And each dice roll will provide 3-bits. You'll want to keep rolling until you fill out all but the last 11-bit word, and 3-bits of the 24th word. As you fill out 3-bits at a time, you can go left-to-right and top-down, and stop after writing 3-bits into the 24th word. The remaining 8-bits of the final word are calculated through a checksum which we'll discuss next. What about 12-Word Seeds? You could also do 12-word seeds, which will give you 128-bits of entropy. You'll fill out 11 of the 11-bit words and 7-bits of the 12th word. The remaining 4-bits will be the checksum. In either case, you'll need to compute the checksum to arrive at a valid final word. This simple checksum is to ensure that you've got a valid seed phrase. A common approach is to add an additional passphrase to the seed words, like a 13th or 25th word, but not constrained to the BIP-39 word list. This passphrase can provide additional bits of entropy, and using a strong passphrase can easily add enough entropy to make a 12-word plus passphrase seed as strong as a 24-word seed. Complete the Checksum \u00b6 Completing the final word requires a checksum. In this case a sha256sum of the 256-bits of entropy. Remember the 24th word has 8-bits for the checksum, which should be the first 8-bits of the shasum. This may sound complicated, but you can use the same secure airgapped computer you plan on using to sign transactions and Self Custody your Bitcoin. If you're just testing this approach feel free to use any computer to calculate the checksum bits. You will run the following shell command, and you'll need to type your exact binary number.

To get the checksum, take the first two hexidecimal digits of the shasum, in this case bb , and convert them to binary. Each hexidecimal digit is exactly 4-bits, and b is 1011 , so bb is 10111011 If you are not sure how to convert hexidecimal digits to binary, or you want to verify you did it correctly, you can verify in python, >>> bin ( int ( \"bb\" , 16 )) '0b10111011' >>> Or you can call the above from the shell, $ python3 -c 'print(bin(int(\"bb\", 16))[2:])' 10111011 $ Once you have the first 8 binary digits of the checksum, simply add those to the worksheet to complete your 24th word. The 3-bits from dice plus the 8-bits from the sha256sum will complete all 11-bits off the word. Seed Word Lookup \u00b6 Now that you have all the binary values, you can resolve each of the 24 values to its corresponding BIP-39 seed word . There are many ways to do this, and a helpful place to start is to reference a printable version of the BIP-39 words.

This is because true randomness is surprisingly difficult to achieve on a computer. This is referred to as Entropy , that is, a measure of randomness. For example, a fair coin flip is 1-bit of entropy; flipping two coins can offer 2-bits of entropy (4 possible outcomes). But if one of the coins is unfair and always lands on heads, then we're back to only 1-bit of entropy from the first coin. The goal of a seed phrase is to achieve the maximimum amount of entropy that would prevent anyone from deriving or guessing your seed phrase. Beware of Low Entropy A 24-word seed phrase is nothing more than an encoding of a 256-bit number (with a checksum at the end). If all 256-bits were the same, that is, all zeros except the checksum, then this would have very low entropy. The seed phrase would simply be, abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon art That's 23 abandon 's and 1 art Turns out this ridiculous 1-bit of entropy phrase was actually used before. You can recover this wallet and view the transaction history for yourself. For 2-hours in 2016 there was 346.9341 Bitcoin stored with this key. Perhaps it's part of a Steganographic puzzle, and this is the an entry into finding a hidden fortune. Or perhaps someone didn't know what they were doing and lost all their Bitcoin. How to get High Entropy? In the above example, it took less than a second to discover a seed phrase protected only by 1-bit of entropy. How long would it take for 256-bits of entropy? 256-bits of entropy is difficult to fathom. You might hear \"centuries\" or \"millions of years\", but it's more like, \"beyond the age of the universe even with planet-sized super-computers powered by Dyson-spheres around every star.\" It's the same as flipping a coin 256 times. Not exactly a difficult task, but assuming it was a fair coin then this would get you 256-bits of entropy, and the odds of anyone guessing or deriving that exact 256-bit number is impossible (unless they watched you flipping the coin). It's like finding a needle in a haystack -- if the haystack was the entire universe, and also the needle was invisible. Numeric Base of Dice \u00b6 We usually deal with Base-10 (decimal) and Base-2 (binary). In fact, when we say \"bits\" we're referring to the length of a binary number. But we can represent a number in any arbitrary base. And this is important because one of the best sources of true random numbers is fair dice rolls. A common 6-sided dice can be used to generate a 256-bit number, but doing so can be somewhat confusing. You may try to map the numbers to binary but you'll find it's not so easy (1 dice gives you roughly 2.5-bits of entropy). To be safe you could just map odd and even rolls to binary 1 and 0, but this requires 256 dice rolls and isn't very efficient. A better aproach is to use a Base-6 representation of a 256-bit number, which would require 99 dice rolls. This is the minimum number of fair dice rolls necessary to achieve 256-bits of entropy. Alternatively, and my recommendation, is to use an 8-sided dice, the kind commonly found in role-playing games. A fair 8-sided dice roll has exactly 3-bits of entropy (meaning every 8-sided dice roll gives you exactly 3 of the desired 256-bits). With this approach you'll need 85 rolls to generate sufficient entropy for a seed phrase. 256-bits in other Bases \u00b6 Numeric Base length Description Base-2 (binary) 256 coin tosses Base-6 99 dice rolls Base-8 (octal) 85 8-sided dice rolls Base-10 (decimal) 77 770-Quattuorvigintillion Base-20 59 20-sided dice rolls Base-64 43 I-Ching Hexagrams Base-2048 24 seed words How to Ensure Fair Dice \u00b6 There's a strange phenomenon in the Bitcoin community where they insist on casino-grade dice; as if \"casino\" is an infallible authority on dice grading that we should trust our life savings with. Don't trust, verify If you're concerned with the fairness of dice, then you should verify your dice with a saltwater balance test . Whether using \"AAA casino-grade razor-edge precision dice\" or using the dice you got from a board game, a saltwater test can verify if the dice is balanced or not. Just saying \"Casino-grade\" is not a verification. In most cases, even a slightly unbalanced dice will still roll fairly, but it's recommended to verify that a given set of dice (casino-grade or otherwise) is balanced so you'll know it can generate the desired level of entropy. Saltwater Balance Test \u00b6 You'll find many examples online , mostly from dedicated communities around board games, RPGs, and gambling aficionados. God bless our fellow nerds. In practice, you simply need a cup of supersaturated saltwater . This just means the water cannot absorb any more salt and that your dice will become buoyant. In a clean cup, fill with clean filtered water Add salt, a lot of salt , and stir till the salt is fully absorbed in the water Keep adding salt and stirring until your dice becomes buoyant Once the dice is floating towards the surface you'll be able to test if it's balanced or not. Simply push the dice with a pencil or chopstick. Balanced Dice src An unbalanced dice will float upward favoring one side. It will be obvious. In practice this could be due to air-bubbles or inconsistent materials. Unbalanced Dice src Using this very simply technique you can verify your dice are balanced and can safely be used to generate high levels of entropy. You'll find the \"casino-grade\" dice offer no benefit over standard board game dice, and most importantly you'll have verified your dice.

A better aproach is to use a Base-6 representation of a 256-bit number, which would require 99 dice rolls. This is the minimum number of fair dice rolls necessary to achieve 256-bits of entropy. Alternatively, and my recommendation, is to use an 8-sided dice, the kind commonly found in role-playing games. A fair 8-sided dice roll has exactly 3-bits of entropy (meaning every 8-sided dice roll gives you exactly 3 of the desired 256-bits). With this approach you'll need 85 rolls to generate sufficient entropy for a seed phrase.","title":"Numeric Base of Dice"},{"location":"custody/creating-keys/dice/#256-bits-in-other-bases","text":"Numeric Base length Description Base-2 (binary) 256 coin tosses Base-6 99 dice rolls Base-8 (octal) 85 8-sided dice rolls Base-10 (decimal) 77 770-Quattuorvigintillion Base-20 59 20-sided dice rolls Base-64 43 I-Ching Hexagrams Base-2048 24 seed words","title":"256-bits in other Bases"},{"location":"custody/creating-keys/dice/#how-to-ensure-fair-dice","text":"There's a strange phenomenon in the Bitcoin community where they insist on casino-grade dice; as if \"casino\" is an infallible authority on dice grading that we should trust our life savings with. Don't trust, verify If you're concerned with the fairness of dice, then you should verify your dice with a saltwater balance test . Whether using \"AAA casino-grade razor-edge precision dice\" or using the dice you got from a board game, a saltwater test can verify if the dice is balanced or not. Just saying \"Casino-grade\" is not a verification. In most cases, even a slightly unbalanced dice will still roll fairly, but it's recommended to verify that a given set of dice (casino-grade or otherwise) is balanced so you'll know it can generate the desired level of entropy.","title":"How to Ensure Fair Dice"},{"location":"custody/creating-keys/dice/#saltwater-balance-test","text":"You'll find many examples online , mostly from dedicated communities around board games, RPGs, and gambling aficionados. God bless our fellow nerds. In practice, you simply need a cup of supersaturated saltwater . This just means the water cannot absorb any more salt and that your dice will become buoyant. In a clean cup, fill with clean filtered water Add salt, a lot of salt , and stir till the salt is fully absorbed in the water Keep adding salt and stirring until your dice becomes buoyant Once the dice is floating towards the surface you'll be able to test if it's balanced or not. Simply push the dice with a pencil or chopstick. Balanced Dice src An unbalanced dice will float upward favoring one side. It will be obvious. In practice this could be due to air-bubbles or inconsistent materials. Unbalanced Dice src Using this very simply technique you can verify your dice are balanced and can safely be used to generate high levels of entropy. You'll find the \"casino-grade\" dice offer no benefit over standard board game dice, and most importantly you'll have verified your dice. No trust required!","title":"Saltwater Balance Test"},{"location":"custody/creating-keys/multisig/","text":"Creating Multisig Keys \u00b6 ...","title":"Multisig"},{"location":"custody/creating-keys/multisig/#creating-multisig-keys","text":"...","title":"Creating Multisig Keys"},{"location":"custody/protocols/","text":"Protocols \u00b6 ... https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Links_to_Storage_Methods#Cold_Storage_Methods","title":"Protocols"},{"location":"custody/protocols/#protocols","text":"... https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Links_to_Storage_Methods#Cold_Storage_Methods","title":"Protocols"},{"location":"custody/protocols/custom/","text":"Custom Self-Custody Protocol \u00b6 ...","title":"Custom Self-Custody"},{"location":"custody/protocols/custom/#custom-self-custody-protocol","text":"...","title":"Custom Self-Custody Protocol"},{"location":"custody/protocols/glacier/","text":"Glacier Protocol \u00b6 ...","title":"Glacier"},{"location":"custody/protocols/glacier/#glacier-protocol","text":"...","title":"Glacier Protocol"},{"location":"custody/protocols/proof-of-control/","text":"Proof-of-Control Protocol \u00b6 ...","title":"Proof-of-Control"},{"location":"custody/protocols/proof-of-control/#proof-of-control-protocol","text":"...","title":"Proof-of-Control Protocol"},{"location":"custody/securing-keys/","text":"Securing Keys \u00b6 ...","title":"Securing Keys"},{"location":"custody/securing-keys/#securing-keys","text":"...","title":"Securing Keys"},{"location":"custody/securing-keys/bare-metal/","text":"Bare Metal Keys \u00b6 ...","title":"Bare Metal"},{"location":"custody/securing-keys/bare-metal/#bare-metal-keys","text":"...","title":"Bare Metal Keys"},{"location":"custody/securing-keys/hardware-wallets/","text":"Hardware Wallets \u00b6 ...
