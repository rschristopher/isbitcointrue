Bitcoin -- if it is true -- fixes all of the problems of fiat money, even modern art. The problem of fiat money \u00b6 Bitcoin was designed to fix the problem of fiat money, which is the problem of politics and money, an incessant problem that has burdened human civilization throughout history. You may have gotten into Bitcoin as an investment; a high-risk and volatile investment; an investment into the best performing asset of all time. And yet, Bitcoin was not designed to be an investment. Bitcoin was designed to be money, sound money that can fix the problems of fiat money -- it is in this regard that we ask: is Bitcoin true? The problems of fiat money run deep, beyond the ever-increasing price of meat and potatoes -- shaping Politics and War, Food and Health, Education and Research, Science and Innovation -- and yes, even modern art . Even modern art? \u00b6 modern art under fiat This is an actual piece of art -- that sold . There are many such examples, along with eye-roll inducing apologetics, such that the banana represents a critique of the very problems of modern art that everyone is criticizing. Janitors protested the banana for pay inequality, another artist ate the banana, and still another wrote \"Epstein didn't kill himself\" on the wall in red lipstick. Even the artists and the art dealers know that modern art is vapid nonsense, and so they perform self-referential pieces of art, criticising themselves, being cynical about cynicism -- someone will then call the self-referential cynicism \"genius\" -- and why stop if the money keeps rolling in? Rather than ask what is and what is not art, instead ask how art collectors have money for this kind of art, and why they see value in it. And most importantly, find out where that money came from. Where does money come from? \u00b6 Money operates as a measure of value, subjective value based on the perceptions of those buying and selling. Money also stores value, value to be used in the future. The time between earning money and spending money is known as \"saving\". This simple and subjective sense of value is all that money is and ever will be. It is best understood as a technology, such that good money will be more efficient than bad money. It can be strong money with a fixed supply, or it can be easy money with an inflationary supply. Inflationary money disprupts the natural cycle of saving, replacing the age old \"saving for the future\" with consumerism, with credit and debt, with a system of constant spending -- because money that constantly loses value is simply worth more now than it will be in the future. Worse, fiat money is inflationary at the whims of those who control the money supply. There is a reason janitors have less purchasing power than ever before. And it's not because a wealthy person controlled this outcome. If you are a janitor earning fiat money, you will work harder and harder, but you will earn less and less value over time . And that amount of lost value will be gained by those known as cantilion insiders, those close to the money supply, those who benefit from increases in the money supply, including art collectors. An art collector's salary will also lose value over time, just like the janitor. However, assets such as real-estate and art will increase in value. Inflating the money supply doesn't just drive up prices of consumer goods, it first inflates the value of hard assets, transfering wealth from those who work and save, to those who own hard assets. And if you dig deep enough, you'll find that most art collectors don't actually earn a salary, have never earned a salary, and that their wealth is not stored in cash. Political solultions make the problem worse, and over time those controlling the money supply use their ill-gotten gains (known as seigniorage ) to control the politics (regardless of the system), so it inevitably becomes a rigged game (be it a democracy or theocracy or socialist dictatorship or otherwise). Revolutions change the faces of the problem, but like the word implies, a revolution is to move in a circle. There is no political solution. If you ever wonder why seemingly diverse modern societies are struggling with consumerism, environmental catastrophes, health epidemics where supposedly \"wealthy\" populations are malnourished and dying younger, and fighting endless wars over control of oil -- look no further than the source of all this misery -- fiat money, where unaccountable bureaucrats control the supply of money at the expense of civilization itself. While the current round of non-sustainable monetary parasitism began in 1971 , this problem is as old as time. Whether it's causal or not can be debated, but societies fall when their money is debased (just ask the Romans). No reasonable person can believe otherwise. The real question becomes, what can be done about the problem of fiat money? The terrifying truth \u00b6 If Bitcoin is true, it is almost too terrifying to contemplate. Bitcoin simply could not succeed in an honest system. It is merely a set of protocols around a cryptographic ledger designed to prevent any and all centralized control of money; it requires voluntary participation; it is designed such that no one can or will control the monetary policy . As a consequence of its design, it is slow and less efficient than what a non-corrupt centralized system could achieve. It is only superior to corrupt dishonest systems (because it fixes the bad-actor problem). If Bitcoin is true it would mean that the problems of fiat money are not only real but irreconciliable. It would mean our entire system is built on lies, and that our leaders are parasitic sociopaths, selected by broken incentives that benefit short-term gains at the expense of the future, unknowingly destroying civilization in the process. And it means that we have been participants in this lie. For Americans it means Nixon was worse than liberals believe, and that FDR was even worse than Nixon. It means our media is corrupt propaganda, and that our political parties are nothing but the coordinators of this propaganda. And none of this is by design but is a consequence of the fiat system itself; of the broken incentives that reward short-term gains at the expense of civilization. Such a system will discourage you from ever discovering, where does money come from? This is a lot to take in for even a cynical person. You've been lied to about money, by people who aren't particularly competent, told that money doesn't grow on trees and then to look the other way when money is created from nothing; all by the whims of parasitic sociopaths that know not what they do. It's tempting to believe the lies, either that they don't exist (it's all just a conspiracy theory) or to believe they exist and are competent enough to actually control money. But the terrifying truth is that they do exist, but are completely incompetent. They don't understand that one cannot actually control money. No one can control money , because money relies on the ever-changing perspectives of value of every person on earth. Money is technology Money is the technology that allows for the ever-changing perspectives of value (of every human on earth) to be made known and measurable, that is, to have what are known as prices and markets . Money requires freedom, freedom to change your mind on a whim, to change your perception of value based on the ever-changing demands in your life. One cannot control money without controlling the subjective values of every person on earth, controlling not just their thoughts, but their innate sense of value, and all the externalities that might cause them to react, rendering them less than cattle, less than rats, something more akin to cogs in a machine, a machine that is controlled by -- who exactly? \"Bitcoin fixes this\" \u00b6 This oft-repeated quote struck me as too good to be true, the wishful thinking of youthful idealists who are all theory with no real-world experience, those unprepared for the chaotic realpolitik of life. And yet, if what is claimed about Bitcoin is true, then it could fix the damaging effects of inflationary money. If the supply is truly scarce, now and in the future; and if the network is truly decentralized, such that no system of authority can control or kill it, then yes, logically, Bitcoin could fix many of the problems of fiat money. But like I said, that all seems too good to be true. Like trying to contemplate what life would be like if people were always honest and forthright; if everyone was kind, humble, and forgiving. People aren't always that way, and it's not helpful to pretend otherwise. And yet, Bitcoin assumes the opposite, that no one can be trusted. don't trust, verify The entire design of Bitcoin is a trustless system that assumes no one is honest. No one. You must verify everything. If there's something we can't verify, then trust is required, in which case we're back to fiat, back to the very problem that Bitcoin is trying to solve. For Bitcoin to be true, everything must be verifiable. Why not other Cryptocurrencies? \u00b6 Altcoins are not attempting to solve the problem Bitcoin solves. They offer no scarcity, and no true decentralization. Most are free market monies that operate as securities. They sometimes offer interesting features because they're digital money, but without scarcity over time. Most are merely copies of Bitcoin but with a centralized source of control, completely defeating the point, which is why you will hear them referred to as \"shitcoins\". Shitcoins cannot solve the problem of fiat money. And they don't try. In all cases they are attempting to become fiat money, granting seigniorage to their own founders. Bitcoin is in a category all its own, a scarce digital resource, a superior money. If Bitcoin is true, then it wins in the end, outcompeting all other money, potentially redeeming civilization in the process. Anything less than that would prove Bitcoin false. What if Bitcoin is false? \u00b6 What if in our journey to verify everything we miss something? And years later we realize that there was a flaw, something we didn't see, but it becomes obvious once exploited. That's all it would take to prove Bitcoin false -- one small counterexample, a flaw that could not be fixed in a soft fork. If trust was required, then that trust could be exploited -- and those who most effectively violate that trust would become the de-facto controllers of Bitcoin, making it no better than fiat. What then? Nothing will have been fixed. The unsustainable problems of fiat would continue in crisis after crisis. However, having learned about Bitcoin you'll understand money. The chaos of the moderm world will make sense. And you'll realize we needed Bitcoin to be true because there was no alternative. Whether we like it or not, the survival of our civilization depends on overcoming the problem of fiat money. This is the challenge of our generation. The existential threats facing our civilization all point back to fiat money. We cannot solve environmental crises, health crises, meaning crises, or any of the problems in education or politics, not without fixing the broken incentives that created those problems to begin with. Bitcoin has been referred to as energy money , one of the great filters to the advancement of civilization. This is a polite way of saying that civilization cannot advance when parasitic bureaucrats play God through vain attempts at controlling money. But this also means, for Bitcoin to be true, it must succeed as energy money ; it must be the catalyst to advance our civilization. All Bitcoin would have to do is work. Every day that it works is another day that it has not been proven false. We can dare to hope; we can look for criticisms ; or we can support Bitcoin's ascent as a true form of energy money that redeems civilization. The stakes are higher than we can imagine, and what happens next, for better or worse, is up to us.","title":"Is Bitcoin True?"},{"location":"is-bitcoin-true/#is-bitcoin-true","text":"One of my earliest reactions to a deep dive into Bitcoin, was the thought, Bitcoin fixes modern art?!

It must be a de-facto superior money to USD, as well as to all fiat money. It must be so superior that it's ascent is only a matter of when and not if -- this is the only way Bitcoin could be considered true . Global Money \u00b6 Money is the technology that makes known the ever-changing perspectives of value of every human being on earth. Additionally, money must store value over time, and it must be transmittable over large distances, anywhere that humans wish to transact. There has never been a true global money , that is, a money that everyone on earth agrees on as their unit of account , their medium of exchange , and as their store of value . Such a technology has never existed, least of all because such a global money must be properly decentralized and uncensorable. Importantly, anyone who controls monetary technology would have power over everyone else wishing to transact with that money. A global money could only be possible if no one controlled it. As such, Bitcoin can only be true if no one can control or limit who can use it. This means attempts to ban it must fail, as well as attempts to subvert or control its monetary policy. Gold and Silver \u00b6 The closest to a global money was gold and silver. One could travel with gold, and use it in most places, provided it was not seized or stolen. Kingdoms and empires fell, but if their coins were in gold, the monetary value of that gold was preserved and spendable elsewhere. Wars were fought over gold, and if you managed to hold onto your gold, not a paper note but the gold itself, that gold would hold its value over time. For example, under the gold standard $20-USD was roughly an ounce of gold. An unskilled worker might earn only 25-cents per hour -- a mere $40 per month -- 2-ounces of gold per month. At today's gold price this is well over $20/hour. Gold-backed money provided a living wage to even the lowest paid workers. Unfortunately, gold cannot be transmitted quickly nor cheaply over large distances. This limitation gives rise to an inevitable system of credit, and then to promisory notes which then lead to fractional reserve, and stey-by-step to pure fiat; money that is backed by-- what exactly? Petrodollar \u00b6 Today, the world operates on a quasi-global currency known as the USD, or more aptly, the petrodollar . It began after 1971 , after a sovereign debt default which ended what was left of the gold standard. For all its faults, the petrodollar system is why you can freely exchange your USD to Canadian dollars or Euros or Yen or Yuan. Almost anywhere on earth you go, you can probably find an ATM that will allow you to withdraw the local currency (at a relatively stable exchange rate). Despite the many problems of fiat money, this technology was itself revolutionary, allowing decades of economic growth on a global scale. The dirty secret was that this economic growth hid the seigniorage of central bankers that has inadvertantly bankrupted every country on earth, strip mined capital , transformed stockpiles of wealth into an unsustainable mountain of debt that can never be paid back (it is money backed by debt afterall). And of course, the not so secret secret, this system requires continuous war over oil. The petrodollar system depends on two critical elements, US military dominance US relations with Saudi Arabia In other words, if Saudi Arabia should fall, the USD petrodollar would collapse overnight. Similarly, if the US military was not the de-facto dominant power on earth, then the USD would collapse (hyperinflating against stronger money). Likewise, if the US government was to collapse, so too would the USD petrodollar system. This bizarre web of dependencies is what it means today to be the global reserve currency . Unlike gold and silver, the petrodollar depends entirely on the US government, the US Treasury, the Federal Reserve, the US military, the Saudi government, and a stable relationship between the US and the Saudis. Fiat Interregnum \u00b6 The design of Bitcoin is to solve the problems of fiat money. As such, if Bitcoin is true then it will inevitably become the money of international settlement, ending the era of fiat money. Bitcoin need not be adopted nor even accepted by the fiat bureaucrats; the truth of Bitcoin is not determined by fiat. For Bitcoin to be true, it need only to work. International settlements must work using Bitcoin. And doing so will reveal the impotence of the parasitic bureaucrats that imagine themselves as in control. Bitcoin is true because it works, and the consequences of that may not be agreeable to most (least of all to the beneficiaries of the fiat system itself). The fiat system produces bureaucratic cruft, delusions of power that arise from the noise of the system, obscuring price signals and creating a class of professional bureaucrats whose job it is to pretend to control money. Bitcoin doesn't make them obsolete, it proves they have been impotent all along, like court astrologers. Under the gold standard, it wasn't the king that gave value to money, it was the gold. The monetary value of gold was all that mattered. Similarly, under a Bitcoin standard, Bitcoin is all that will matter, not its adoption by bureaucrats. In the long arch of history, the modern fiat system is a mere blip as we transition from gold to true global money. This blip of modern fiat was birthed in 1971 although didn't really prove itself till a few years later. By the 1980s it was ostensibly working, and it was uncontested until 2009, until Bitcoin. And in a sly roundabout way, Bitcoin has risen into prominence as an open source global money, poised to supplant the USD petrodollar. And with every decade of it working, it inches closer to becoming the money of international settlements, the base layer behind all money.","title":"Bitcoin as Money"},{"location":"bitcoin-as-money/#bitcoin-as-money","text":"\u201cI don\u2019t believe we shall ever have a good money again before we take the thing out of the hands of government, that is, we can\u2019t take them violently out of the hands of government, all we can do is by some sly roundabout way introduce something they can\u2019t stop.\u201d ~ Friedrich Hayek If Bitcoin is true, it must be Hayek's \"something\" that government can't stop.

International settlements must work using Bitcoin. And doing so will reveal the impotence of the parasitic bureaucrats that imagine themselves as in control. Bitcoin is true because it works, and the consequences of that may not be agreeable to most (least of all to the beneficiaries of the fiat system itself). The fiat system produces bureaucratic cruft, delusions of power that arise from the noise of the system, obscuring price signals and creating a class of professional bureaucrats whose job it is to pretend to control money. Bitcoin doesn't make them obsolete, it proves they have been impotent all along, like court astrologers. Under the gold standard, it wasn't the king that gave value to money, it was the gold. The monetary value of gold was all that mattered. Similarly, under a Bitcoin standard, Bitcoin is all that will matter, not its adoption by bureaucrats. In the long arch of history, the modern fiat system is a mere blip as we transition from gold to true global money. This blip of modern fiat was birthed in 1971 although didn't really prove itself till a few years later. By the 1980s it was ostensibly working, and it was uncontested until 2009, until Bitcoin. And in a sly roundabout way, Bitcoin has risen into prominence as an open source global money, poised to supplant the USD petrodollar. And with every decade of it working, it inches closer to becoming the money of international settlements, the base layer behind all money.","title":"Fiat Interregnum"},{"location":"bitcoin-as-money/fixed-supply/","text":"Fixed Supply \u00b6 Let's consider this classic chart that you may have seen in various corners of the Internet. I've seen many versions of this chart, and always felt there was a lot overlooked. Yes, it's a textbook example of fiat currency hyperinflation, but let's dig a little deeper. We can find the raw Weimar Inflation Data online, and using this we can plot the classic hyperbolic price of gold shown above. Additionally, we can track things like the all time high (ATH) and changes to that ATH. We can scale this out to get a better look at the volatility in the gold price over time. For example, This gives us two distinct stories. We know the story of the gold price . Inflationary paper money will inevitably end this way. However, the volatility is an often overlooked story. There was extreme volatility in the price of gold, as well as in real estate and other hard assets. For well over a year the price was dropping, crashing to less than 50% of its ATH. And then every time there was a new ATH, it was followed for months on end of a painful bear market. And then the process would repeat. The frequency of these painful cycles increased, as did the volatility. The people of Germany in 1921 lacked the benefit of hindsight that we have looking at this classic story of a currency collapse. Instead, they lived through massive uncertainty, holding gold through periods where it seemed to be losing value. And then other periods where the number would go up and up, only to crash once again -- until finally, the mark itself crashed, hyperinflated into oblivion. A fixed supply is not only important, but critical. And as all fiat currencies have demonstrated, inflation is impossible to avoid. In the early days it can be tamed and even reduced, but eventually it grows along with all the consequent problems of fiat money. Is a Fixed Supply Feasible? \u00b6 A fixed supply is not possible through wishful thinking nor central planning. These attempts have all failed, and continue to fail. Gold and silver were more successful as money than other metals simply because their supply was more limited. And yet, the inflation rate of gold (the increase in supply) has historically hovered around 2%. That means every year there is 2% more gold than the previous year. A gold standard means 2% annual inflation. At present, Bitcoin's inflation rate is equal to gold, and after the next halving (likely in May 2024), Bitcoin will become the least inflationary monetary asset the world has ever known. How is it Possible? \u00b6 Many Bitcoiners will tell you to read the code . And yes, the code at the moment will fix the supply at 21 million. GetBlockSubsidy Every 210,000 blocks (roughly every 4 years) the block subsidy (new Bitcoin mined) is reduced in half, and it started at 50. You can calculate 50 times 210,000 to arrive at 10.5 million, exactly half of 21 million. Afterwards, the block subsidy was \"halved\" to 25. Then to 12.5, and we are now in the era of a 6.25 block subsidy. This \"halving\" process will contiue until the year 2140 when the final fraction of a Bitcoin is mined, at which point mining will operate only on transaction fees. CAmount GetBlockSubsidy ( int nHeight , const Consensus :: Params & consensusParams ) { int halvings = nHeight / consensusParams . nSubsidyHalvingInterval ; // Force block reward to zero when right shift is undefined. if ( halvings >= 64 ) return 0 ; CAmount nSubsidy = 50 * COIN ; // Subsidy is cut in half every 210,000 blocks which will occur approximately every 4 years. nSubsidy >>= halvings ; return nSubsidy ; } The >>= operator in the code is a bit shift right, which has the effect of halving a number, e.g., 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.125, 1.5625, ... But this doesn't answer the question. How can I know that this fixed supply won't change in the future? How do I know we're not one pull-request away from inflationary money? How do I know that the future supply of Bitcoin won't be controlled by incompetent bureaucrats? Well, it's open-source code. Try modifying it and see what happens. Create your own pull-request to change this function. Now, obviously such a change won't be approved, but what if it was? Let's say the supply cap was changed -- would that be the end of Bitcoin? Such a change would break consensus rules, and would be considered a hard fork, that is, the original software would reject all new blocks on this new version, and it would require all the miners and nodes to upgrade. A conscious choice amongst every participant in the Bitcoin network. Those that refused would just continue as they were, running nodes, mining blocks, and transacting Bitcoin based on the 21 million fixed supply. The developers that refused would continue developing the original version and would enjoy the support of everyone who wished to stay on the original fixed supply version. This is, it turns out, exactly what has happened many many times before. The so called altcoins (or shitcoins ) are the result of exactly these kind of hard forks.

Buying a pizza or a coffee, selling a car, all are examples of using money as a medium of exchange. This is an important area where Bitcoin has a distinct advantage and a perceived disadvantage compared to traditional forms of currency such as gold and silver coins. This is also an area where fiat, for all its faults, has proven superior to gold. Simply put, using fiat payment rails for small purchases is often more usable than any alternative. Importantly, this perceived advantage of fiat as a medium of exchange hides the fact that those seemingly quick and easy payments are sitting atop an outdated and painfully inefficient system of final settlement. Final Settlement \u00b6 Money as a medium of exchange for small payments is very different than final settlement. Bitcoin is unparalleled in its ability to perform final settlement. As a digital money, Bitcoin is extremely advantageous in that it can be transacted anywhere on earth in any arbitrary amount. You don't need to look for exact change, and you don't need to mail a check. With Bitcoin you send a transaction and wait for final settlement. The ability to attain final settlement anywhere on earth in any amount and without any trusted intermediaries or authority is unprecedented, and is why Bitcoin -- if it is true -- is the most superior form of money to ever exist. This is also why Bitcoin may inevitably become the money of international settlement. However, because Bitcoin is fully decentralized and trustless, relying on transaction fees and block time , this poses a perceived disadvantage; you must wait for new blocks in order to reach final settlement. This wait plus transaction fees makes Bitcoin seemingly impractical for small purchases such as a cup of coffee. Or rather, trying to achieve final international settlement for the purchase of a cup of coffee is quite the overkill. Neither gold nor fiat provide final settlement for a cup of coffee. Gold lends itself to a system of credits and typically relied on a bimetal monetary system where silver coins acted as a medium of exchange. Fiat relies on outdated banking cores , and in practice takes weeks or months for something as simply as a cup of coffee to reach final settlement. The exception to this is cash on hand, promissory notes, which reach final settlement the moment two trusted parties transact. Cash payments are quite efficient but must be done in person, and require trust (trust in the fiat currency itself, and trust that the promissory note in question is not a counterfeit). There is no known completely trustless medium of exchange, that is, not until Bitcoin over the lightning network. Lightning Network \u00b6 Bitcoin, like the Internet itself, offers a layered architecture. Final settlement is guaranteed on the base layer, and payment networks such as the Lightning network are built on top of the base layer. You can put some Bitcoin into a lightning channel through a base layer transaction, and you can use that to buy your coffee in a fast and highly scalable payment network. Think of this as petty cash, like spending from a gift card, only faster and with verifiable payments. Meanwhile the base layer is used only for final settlement. And yet Lightning offers its own verifiable settlements. It can do this because it is built on the Bitcoin network as a 2nd layer, gaining the security and stability of the base layer. Bitcoin on the Lightning network is backed by transactions on the base layer. The movement of Bitcoin on the Lightning network simply shifts the balances between owners. E.g., if you start with 0.5 Bitcoin on the Lightning network and spend 0.1, and separately someone pays you 0.05, then your balance of 0.45 Bitcoin can be settled on the base layer. Closing a Lightning channel requires a base layer transaction. In fact, if you have an open Lightning channel, then you have a guaranteed transaction that could be made on the base layer to close that channel. That guaranteed base-layer transaction is why lightning payments can settle instantly. If you start with a guaranteed 0.5 Bitcoin, and you spend 0.1, your original \"guaranteed 0.5 Bitcoin\" transaction is replaced by one with 0.4 Bitcoin. Lightning network is merely a protocol keeping track of the guaranteed transactions that could be made on the base layer. So while base-layer settlement is slow, waiting for 3 or more confirmed blocks, Lightning settlement is instant, and that instant settlement is backed by the guaranteed transaction that could be made on the base-layer. Bitcoin as Currency \u00b6 In practice, the capacity of the Lightning network, that is, the total amount of Bitcoin in all Lightning channels, represents the circulating supply of Bitcoin as a currency, as a medium of exchange. Because of the decentralized nature of the Lightning network, it is impossible to know how much Bitcoin is being used in private Lightning channels. However, the public (discoverable) channels have seen steadily growing adoption and capacity . And importantly, despite the scaling limitations of settlement on the base-layer, Lightning transactions are infinitely scalable, easily handling millions or theoretically even billions of transactions per second. Lightning demonstrates the importance of a layered architecture as well as the importance of Bitcoin's continuous development. Before there was Lightning, Bitcoin was simply not a viable medium of exchange . Now it offers the most advanced and scalable medium of exchange that the world has ever seen.","title":"Medium of Exchange"},{"location":"bitcoin-as-money/medium-of-exchange/#bitcoin-as-a-medium-of-exchange","text":"You often hear money referred to as currency , that is, the movement of money in exchange for goods and services -- this is money as a medium of exchange .

This is because there are only 32 halvings until the block subsidy will be zero. If you were to replace the 32 with infinity , then the above equation would equal 21-million as an asymptotic limit. That is, it would take infinite time and infinite decimal places to get to 21-million. Monetary Equation \u00b6 The equation (Bitcoin's monetary policy) breaks down as follows: There are 33 block-subsidy eras (0 to 32), each lasting exactly 210,000 blocks. This means each era is roughly 4-years, for a total of 132 years till the final Satoshi is issued. Each era halves the block-subsidy, and after 32 halvings the subsidy would result in a number too small to represent in Satoshis, hence the subsidy will be zero. At that point (block 6,930,000 in the year 2140), there will have been 20,999,999.9769 Bitcoin block subsidies, and from then on Bitcoin mining will operate only on fees (which in practice will have already happened as the prior era subsidy will have already been a single Satoshi). Supply over Time \u00b6 One of the reasons Bitcoin's ledger can be referred to as a timechain is because we know the future supply schedule, e.g., we know the final Satoshi will be issued in the year 2140. This is an often overlooked point. The issuance of Bitcoin is not dependent on its value. Let's repeat that: Issuance of Bitcoin is not dependent on its value. Imagine if the spot-price of gold or silver jumped up to over $1-million. That is, an ounce of silver would fetch more than $1-million. You might go looking for old silver dollars. And how do you think this would effect silver mining? This is so fundamental as to be a law of nature. Increased demand will result in more production. And yet if Bitcoin price goes to $1-million or more, the issuance of new Bitcoin will remain on schedule. Issuance of Bitcoin depends on time. Let's repeat that: Issuance of Bitcoin depends on time. What would happen if, tomorrow, the price of Bitcoin went up to $1-million? Mining would be very profitable. The hashrate would skyrocket. And yet, issuance of new Bitcoin would stay on schedule. This is due to the difficulty adjustment. Difficulty Adjustment \u00b6 Every 2016 blocks there is a difficulty adjustment to maintain a 10-minute average block time. That is, if the average time between each of those 2016 blocks is less than 10-minutes, the difficulty will increase. If the average is more than 10-minutes, the difficulty will decrease. For this reason, while the time between blocks can vary, the average remains 10-minutes. Without a doubt, this is Satoshi Nakamoto 's greatest innovation.

If tulip prices increase, so too will tulip farming, because tulips are not a scarce asset. Increases in the valuation of Bitcoin will lead to more mining as it becomes more profitable, yet those increases will in turn lead to a difficulty adjustment such that the increased mining does not alter the supply schedule. The difficulty adjustment is why Bitcoin's monetary policy will always follow a rather predictable future supply schedule. This seemingly benign difficulty adjustment is what makes Bitcoin the scarcest asset the world has ever known.

Power over money is power over human choice. If a state had complete power over money then there would be no limit to that state's power over those governed. Controlling what people can and cannot buy, you would barely need law enforcement; power over money would be sufficient enforcement of all human behavior and action. Even crimes of passion would become quite difficult if one couldn't buy food or water or transportation without permission. Complete power over money would offer total totalitarianism . Such power would render us into something less than slaves, including the people managing the money. The system itself would need to be all powerful, requiring us to be obedient (in action, speech, and thought) to the monetary principalities that emerge from our own base instincts. Worse, we would know this system is corrupt and evil, but we would be unable to speak out against it. Historically, such totalitarianism has proven impossible, collapsing under its own tyrannical fiat. As monetary technology increases -- with all the obvious benefits to humanity -- so too do we increase abuses of power by the state. The desire from the state to wield complete monetary surveillance and control -- as futile and nihilistic as this may prove -- will become irresistible and is in many ways a self-perpetuating existential crisis from the state itself (as monetary technology renders much of the state's bureaucratic controls useless to the interests of the people). We can either limit monetary technology to slow the state's destructive path, which puts our civilization on a dead end, or we separate money from state -- freeing money from the corrupting influence of the state itself. Church and State \u00b6 An often overlooked consequence of the establishment clause of the first amendment of the United States is that rather than liberating politics from the corrupting influence of churches, the opposite was true. Churches, not politics, were set free. This may run contrary to conventional wisdom, to the facade of enlightenment thinking that we arrogantly ascribe, but think about it: has the political class become less corrupt as they separated themselves from religious institutions? Or have the churches lessened their own corruption as they separated from the state, and become increasingly benign places of worship? There is much to be criticized when looking at modern churches, such as their shallow banality with no more sacredness than the strip-malls where they reside, but the inquisition they are not. To the degree a church has been separated from state, that church has been freed of the corrupting influence of the state. In fact, it was state-controlled money that was most often the corrupting influence, not the church nor even the state. Separating money from human control, from oligarchs and autocrats, is the challenge we face. I care not who controls a nation\u2019s political affairs, so long as I control her currency \u2013 Mayer Amschel Rothschild Human Nature \u00b6 One cannot separate human nature from religion nor from money. There have been religions and money as long as there has been humans. The concepts of a store of wealth, of scarce and beautiful artifacts, what we can call proto-money, have existed in every ancient culture. Primitive forms of money are as universal as primitive, usually animistic, religions. Fiat Money and Ancestor Worship Look at the design of paper money and coinage. Founding fathers, kings and queens, and even the most secular and supposedly \"enlightened\" money designs are ostensibly a form of ancestor worship. These animistic tokens functioned well-enough for primitive economies, but are being replaced by digital money, stripped of their animistic nature. And rather than become a source of liberation, digital money has become a system of control, and not by mythological archetypes or even the pretense of a functioning religious system, but by mundane bureaucratic policy makers with unchecked power, parasitically feeding on the the people (people who don't even know the names of their would-be tyrant bureaucrats). Religious beliefs, whether secular or traditional, provide a moral framework and a language with which to communicate what are otherwise transcendent concepts (such as truth, goodness, or meaning in life sufficient to bear the weight of life's suffering). We cannot escape religion, just as we cannot escape money. Without a functioning religious belief, we inevitably fall into a crisis of meaning. And without a functioning money, we inevitably fall into servitude and debt, and eventually into starvation. We cannot escape the very human need for money. But what we can do, is separate money from the state. That is, to set money free from the corrupting influence of the state. To once and for all end the corrupting power of seigniorage -- to relegate money to its proper place, and not as a source of power and worship. Money and State \u00b6 What is the ultimate fate of modern fiat, specifically, what is the fate of the petrodollar system known as USD? Of the hundreds of fiat currencies in the world; of all the unprecedented hyperinflation events occurring around the globe; the lynchpin of this entire damnable fiat money experiment is the USD petrodollar. USD, a brief history The USD was once backed by gold. The very definition of USD was a measure of gold. It was worth roughly $20/ounce. You can still find \"double eagle\" gold coins, roughly one ounce of gold, with the words, \"twenty dollars\", printed very clearly on the coin. Paper notes, meanwhile, were gold certificates (redeemable for gold). In 1933, private gold was seized by the federal government through executive order 6102 . A twenty dollar bill was no longer a \"gold certificate\" but instead a Federal Reserve note. International settlements still happened in gold, but the USD was debased to $35/ounce (extracting wealth from the American people to pay off western war debts). Later, during the Bretton Woods era (starting in 1944), the $35/ounce rate was guaranteed for all international settlements, which continued the legacy of the gold standard, albeit not available to the people of the US. The Bretton Woods system ended in 1971 with the Nixon shock , and shortly after -- in 1974 -- the petrodollar system emerged. Fiat-funded economists proclaimed that the price of gold would drop, thinking that this would remove the monetary premium of gold. And despite the opposite happening, despite wealth transfers from productive workers to cantillon insiders, despite grotesque abuses of power and corruption, despite continuous war in oil-rich countries, despite health epidemics brought about by inflating the price of quality food, despite all the evidence of how disastrous this system has been and continues to be, not a single person was ever held to account for their role in this abject evil. The fate of the existing fiat USD seems obvious, as fiat systems inevitably hyperinflate into oblivion. In the US we are at the brink of hyperinflation despite a shallow cover up. But in the end, people want to eat, feed their families, be healthy, live productive lives that offer a future that is worth their present suffering, oh and of course not die in a gulag or concentration camp. Freedom is a necessity, and without it systems fail. This includes the current leaders. They can't but live in the world too, and act out the very human desire for freedom and flourishing. What made civilization possible was not systems of control, but freedom to live good lives, freedom and opportunity to build your own life, a life that is worth living. The solution to these problems (of money and state), can not be solved by the state. There are no political solutions to problems born of political interventions. The solution can only be a new form of money, superior to fiat money, and superior to gold. Bitcoin has all the properties necessary to be the solution. And while the truth of Bitcoin may take several generations to fully prove, there is no more important problem for us to solve.","title":"Money and State"},{"location":"bitcoin-as-money/money-and-state/#money-and-state","text":"There is no more important problem to solve than the separation of money from state. Power over money is power over human choice. If a state had complete power over money then there would be no limit to that state's power over those governed. Controlling what people can and cannot buy, you would barely need law enforcement; power over money would be sufficient enforcement of all human behavior and action. Even crimes of passion would become quite difficult if one couldn't buy food or water or transportation without permission. Complete power over money would offer total totalitarianism . Such power would render us into something less than slaves, including the people managing the money. The system itself would need to be all powerful, requiring us to be obedient (in action, speech, and thought) to the monetary principalities that emerge from our own base instincts. Worse, we would know this system is corrupt and evil, but we would be unable to speak out against it. Historically, such totalitarianism has proven impossible, collapsing under its own tyrannical fiat. As monetary technology increases -- with all the obvious benefits to humanity -- so too do we increase abuses of power by the state. The desire from the state to wield complete monetary surveillance and control -- as futile and nihilistic as this may prove -- will become irresistible and is in many ways a self-perpetuating existential crisis from the state itself (as monetary technology renders much of the state's bureaucratic controls useless to the interests of the people). We can either limit monetary technology to slow the state's destructive path, which puts our civilization on a dead end, or we separate money from state -- freeing money from the corrupting influence of the state itself.","title":"Money and State"},{"location":"bitcoin-as-money/money-and-state/#church-and-state","text":"An often overlooked consequence of the establishment clause of the first amendment of the United States is that rather than liberating politics from the corrupting influence of churches, the opposite was true. Churches, not politics, were set free. This may run contrary to conventional wisdom, to the facade of enlightenment thinking that we arrogantly ascribe, but think about it: has the political class become less corrupt as they separated themselves from religious institutions? Or have the churches lessened their own corruption as they separated from the state, and become increasingly benign places of worship? There is much to be criticized when looking at modern churches, such as their shallow banality with no more sacredness than the strip-malls where they reside, but the inquisition they are not. To the degree a church has been separated from state, that church has been freed of the corrupting influence of the state. In fact, it was state-controlled money that was most often the corrupting influence, not the church nor even the state.

Once you see the pattern you'll see it everywhere. The critic simply claims that a percieved weakness is more important and relevant than it actually is. Here are some of the most common examples of this strategy: criminals use Bitcoin mining uses a lot of electricity it's not fairly distributed the price is too volatile the fixed supply prevents emergency funding The problem with the above arguments is that none of them would disprove Bitcoin (even if the claims were valid -- they are not, but that's irrelavant). This form of argument is a kind of trap, similar to Bulverism , where the critic simply distracts with unrelated noise, explaining why something is wrong without actually showing a critical flaw. For example, Bitcoin can be true AND used by criminals, and still have a volatile fiat price, and be unfairly distributed, and so on -- the question of whether Bitcoin is true is irrelevant to all of those concerns. Bitcoin fixes -- everything? \u00b6 In the spirit of steelmanning a more useful critique, we can examine the inverse of this argument, that Bitcoin is or should be perfect. What many would call hopium, naive Bitcoiners act as if Bitcoin is the panacea to fix all of society's ills. And even more dangerous is to hold Bitcoin to an impossible standard and refuse or resist adoption till it becomes perfect . Perfect is the enemy of good * It is important to remember that Bitcoin is not, and need not be, perfect. Bitcoin only needs to be true, sufficiently true that it cannot be stopped or centralized. Good enough? \u00b6 To push this criticism into steelman territory, let's consider that there does exist a set of necessary conditions for Bitcoin to survive now and in the future. If not perfect , it must be good enough . But what does that mean for Bitcoin to be good enough ? Bitcoin requires a sufficiently advanced civilization with electricity, computers, and a global network. Bitcoin will also need self-interested developers, and self-interested users, and self-interested miners -- all to preserve the value and decentralization of the network. While this does exist now, there is no reason to believe this will persist into the future. Adopting Bitcoin is very much an act of faith -- Faith that civilization can and should persist, that human progress will and should continue, and that a universal unit-of-account is beneficial towards these ends. To not believe in the above (with sufficient faith, beyond just rational self-interest) is to bow to a form nihilism that not even Bitcoin could survive. In other words, Bitcoin depends on human civilization to survive and flourish. If humans cannot make it, then neither can Bitcoin. However, even with faith in human civilization, there are some very difficult compromises that Bitcoin has faced, and will continue to face. Most concerning is privacy and decentralization. Bitcoin is not perfectly decentralized, and it is not perfectly private. Compromises were made. Imperfect privacy \u00b6 In order to provide full transparency and full auditability of its supply, Bitcoin is not fully private nor anonymous -- it is pseudonymous. In other words, sending and receiving Bitcoin is like writing under a pseudonym. You can create as many wallets (each with as many addresses) as you like. Bitcoin gives you the tools for privacy, but it guarantees nothing; you could disclose your addresses allowing others to surveil your Bitcoin. As a result, it is not and never can be as private as cash. Privacy is even a problem amongst Bitcoiners. For example, there are many fanatic Bitcoiners that simply do not use lightning payment rails out of concern for privacy; they do not run private lightning channels and learn how to secure their nodes -- instead, they continue to use fiat payment rails (with a kind of blindspot to the privacy problems with fiat) and they will say \"more work needs to be done for lightning adoption\". And while this is true -- more work is always needed -- we do not wait for others to do the work. If you're capable of informed criticism, then you're capable of contributing to a BIP Ultimately, there is no perfect privacy, there is only a cultural attitude to value and fight for privacy (or not). Bitcoin provides us with sufficient tools for privacy, but the rest is up to us. Cryptography provides us an asymmetric advantage to favor privacy, but we cannot expect any cryptographic system to guarantee privacy if we ourselves don't value it. Imperfect decentralization \u00b6 Bitcoin compromises decentralization in order to maintain a fully auditable fixed supply with no conflicts -- an undisputed ledger. Specifically, the consensus rules solve any disputes in the ledger through proof-of-work consensus. In a conflict (divergent timechains) the chain with the most proof-of-work will win, the other chain will lose (erasing those transactions). Most of the whitepaper was dedicated to this exact problem, the famed 51% attack: if anyone could achieve 51% or more of the total network hashrate (the work in proof-of-work) then they could control the network. They could use this power for good or evil, but it's centralized either way. This is why the security of the network depends on the enormous cost (in terms of money and ingenuity) of a 51% attack over a given number of blocks. Mining benefits from economies of scale and as such we did see larger and larger mining companies with early signs of monopolization -- right up until they went bankrupt. Fortunate to the health of the network (but not to the miners), mining is zero sum and it has so far proved impossible to monopolize. diseconomies of scale within Bitcoin mining must always be greater than its economies of scale There is no guarantee that there will never be a mining monopoly -- and while this is not necessarily a risk to the fixed supply, this is a severe risk to transaction processing. If you want a transaction in the ledger you go through miners, and if mining was ever monopolized, there would be a centralized point-of-control of who could (and could not) transact on chain. A miner with a majority of the hashrate could simply ignore all other miners, knowing full well it will always win any divergent timechains, meaning its mempool selection would be the only one that matters. This would effectively prove Bitcoin false. Because it would be centralized, the monopoly miner would be the sole arbiter for all international settlements. They could set any premiums they wanted on transaction fees. They could censor any/all transactions. They could push people to second layer payment rails that they control (as they could censor all competition), giving them full control over currency. And they could do all this without breaking consensus rules. Eventually, even the power of seigniorage could be gained (on a secondary layer) and the system would become yet another bloated fiat monetary system. Only time will tell whether the game theory behind Bitcoin is sufficient to ensure decentralization. And perhaps it will come down to a small group of zealots that understand this problem and build their own decentralized mining infrastructure.

Many would-be critics will claim that Bitcoin cannot succeed because it is deflationary by nature and would create a deflationary death spiral. These kind of criticisms tend to be poorly thought out (and unfounded by empirical evidence), mostly naive rationalizations to justify the continued non-sustainable debt cycle of fiat-funded economics. However, in a debt-backed economy, like our current USD petrodollar, any kind of deflation is in-fact deadly due to the cost of the debt increasing. Debt-backed Money \u00b6 Debt-backed money like the USD petrodollar is essentially an IOU The modern USD is an \"IOU\" from the Federal Reserve, a promise that they'll provide value in the future -- yet that future never comes. They just print more money (expand their balance sheet) to manage the ever-increasing debt. Debt management becomes difficult if not impossible in a deflationary environment, which is why inflation is the necessary tool of central banks managing debt-backed money via fiat. If your money is based on debt, and you can increase the supply at will (lowering the value of your debt) then all that is needed is to maintain inflation (literally by fiat ) without destroying confidence in the currency. Strong money, like Bitcoin, is effectively the antithesis to debt-backed money -- punishing debt and rewarding saving. And yes, deflationary spirals are indeed a threat to debt-backed money -- but not to Bitcoin. Bitcoin is effectively non-compatible with debt-backed money. Great Depression \u00b6 The most common example of a deflationary spiral is the Great Depression , somehow confusing deflation based on economic contraction with deflation based on economic growth. But even so, was deflation the cause of the Great Depression? The displaced farmers were not sitting on stockpiles of gold, refusing to spend because the value of their savings was increasing. The displaced farmers had no savings, they were starving as their livelihoods were replaced by tractors and industrialization. Any gold they had would have been spent on food (leading to price inflation as their savings became liquid). Blaming the Great Depression on deflation should be considered too stupid and detached from reality to take seriously. However, we can still attempt to steel-man this issue and discuss the potential disadvantages of a strong money (specifically, a deflationary currency). Price Deflation \u00b6 Deflation from economic depression is not the same as deflation from economic growth. This should be obvious, but our current economic models somehow -- conveniently for those benefiting from inflation -- miss this point entirely. Obviously, deflation due to economic contraction is bad. Prices shrinking because no one has money to spend -- this is bad. However, prices dropping because of economic growth -- such as the price of consumer electronics over the last few decades -- this is good, very good. This is the good kind of deflation that never gets mentioned by fiat-funded academics (this is what fueled our economy over the last few decades). Price deflation very clearly increases economic activity, and during times of economic growth this should be encouraged. This is, in fact, exactly what a strong money like Bitcoin encourages. Bitcoin is deflationary only due to economic growth. When there is an economic contraction, Bitcoin behaves the opposite -- prices will inflate as there is simply less goods being produced (constraining supply). Yet what happens when there is a surplus of goods during an economic downturn? This is unfortunately what happened during the Great Depression. The farmers didn't return to their small family farms after the recovery. Their jobs and homesteads were replaced by tractors. Industrialization is what displaced those farmers, leading to a surplus of workers and not enough jobs. The \"recovery\" happened when those displaced farmers found new jobs in factories. Pretending that money printing would have solved this phenomenon is foolish. Printing money during an economic depression does not solve the cause of the depression, it merely enriches the recipients of the printed money and leads to the problems of fiat money. However, what would have happened had Bitcoin existed during the Great Depression? Let's imagine that the farmers would still have been displaced. Unemployment would have still been high. A surplus of goods would still have occured, leading to reduced prices, the bad kind of deflation. Overall, Bitcoin does not seem to help in these situations, and it does not pretend to. What Bitcoin does is provide protection to your savings should overzealous central planners try to \"fix\" an economic contraction through debasement of your savings. Central planners believe they can help (by spending money that's not theirs), and yet all they can do is make things worse and rationalize their failings into absurd narratives -- such as pretending world wars and depopulation are good for an economy. The Ugly Truth \u00b6 What Bitcoin can do during an economic contraction is send clear price signals. We may not like the signal, but printing money to obscure the truth is a far worse option. Reality is not made by fiat, which is exactly what fiat money aims to do. Bitcoin, during the Great Depression, would have revealed that the price of manual labor on a farm is no longer sufficient to sustain a family, nor is a small family farm sufficient to sustain a family. We know this in hindsight, but how useful would this have been to those farmers? Having known earlier would have saved many families from the degradation of pretending otherwise, of pretending that reality is controlled by politicians. Whether we like it or not, Bitcoin will reveal the true price of money itself, as well as the true price of food during a depression. Bitcoin offers truth, the rest -- as always -- is up to us.","title":"Deflation"},{"location":"criticisms/deflation/#deflationary-spiral","text":"A deflationary spiral is simply deflation (lowering of prices) due to prior deflationary pressure. Many would-be critics will claim that Bitcoin cannot succeed because it is deflationary by nature and would create a deflationary death spiral. These kind of criticisms tend to be poorly thought out (and unfounded by empirical evidence), mostly naive rationalizations to justify the continued non-sustainable debt cycle of fiat-funded economics. However, in a debt-backed economy, like our current USD petrodollar, any kind of deflation is in-fact deadly due to the cost of the debt increasing.","title":"Deflationary Spiral"},{"location":"criticisms/deflation/#debt-backed-money","text":"Debt-backed money like the USD petrodollar is essentially an IOU The modern USD is an \"IOU\" from the Federal Reserve, a promise that they'll provide value in the future -- yet that future never comes. They just print more money (expand their balance sheet) to manage the ever-increasing debt. Debt management becomes difficult if not impossible in a deflationary environment, which is why inflation is the necessary tool of central banks managing debt-backed money via fiat. If your money is based on debt, and you can increase the supply at will (lowering the value of your debt) then all that is needed is to maintain inflation (literally by fiat ) without destroying confidence in the currency. Strong money, like Bitcoin, is effectively the antithesis to debt-backed money -- punishing debt and rewarding saving. And yes, deflationary spirals are indeed a threat to debt-backed money -- but not to Bitcoin. Bitcoin is effectively non-compatible with debt-backed money.","title":"Debt-backed Money"},{"location":"criticisms/deflation/#great-depression","text":"The most common example of a deflationary spiral is the Great Depression , somehow confusing deflation based on economic contraction with deflation based on economic growth. But even so, was deflation the cause of the Great Depression? The displaced farmers were not sitting on stockpiles of gold, refusing to spend because the value of their savings was increasing. The displaced farmers had no savings, they were starving as their livelihoods were replaced by tractors and industrialization. Any gold they had would have been spent on food (leading to price inflation as their savings became liquid). Blaming the Great Depression on deflation should be considered too stupid and detached from reality to take seriously. However, we can still attempt to steel-man this issue and discuss the potential disadvantages of a strong money (specifically, a deflationary currency).","title":"Great Depression"},{"location":"criticisms/deflation/#price-deflation","text":"Deflation from economic depression is not the same as deflation from economic growth. This should be obvious, but our current economic models somehow -- conveniently for those benefiting from inflation -- miss this point entirely. Obviously, deflation due to economic contraction is bad. Prices shrinking because no one has money to spend -- this is bad. However, prices dropping because of economic growth -- such as the price of consumer electronics over the last few decades -- this is good, very good. This is the good kind of deflation that never gets mentioned by fiat-funded academics (this is what fueled our economy over the last few decades). Price deflation very clearly increases economic activity, and during times of economic growth this should be encouraged. This is, in fact, exactly what a strong money like Bitcoin encourages. Bitcoin is deflationary only due to economic growth. When there is an economic contraction, Bitcoin behaves the opposite -- prices will inflate as there is simply less goods being produced (constraining supply). Yet what happens when there is a surplus of goods during an economic downturn? This is unfortunately what happened during the Great Depression. The farmers didn't return to their small family farms after the recovery. Their jobs and homesteads were replaced by tractors. Industrialization is what displaced those farmers, leading to a surplus of workers and not enough jobs. The \"recovery\" happened when those displaced farmers found new jobs in factories. Pretending that money printing would have solved this phenomenon is foolish. Printing money during an economic depression does not solve the cause of the depression, it merely enriches the recipients of the printed money and leads to the problems of fiat money. However, what would have happened had Bitcoin existed during the Great Depression? Let's imagine that the farmers would still have been displaced. Unemployment would have still been high. A surplus of goods would still have occured, leading to reduced prices, the bad kind of deflation. Overall, Bitcoin does not seem to help in these situations, and it does not pretend to. What Bitcoin does is provide protection to your savings should overzealous central planners try to \"fix\" an economic contraction through debasement of your savings.

You'll find many \"scientific\" reports showing that Bitcoin's carbon footprint is larger than, say, the Netherlands . Or that Bitcoin creates more \"e-waste\" than the Netherlands . Why is the Netherlands the benchmark for how much electricity a technology is morally allowed to consume? The problem with these arguments is that they're entirely disingenuous and false. Bitcoin mining operates on electricity -- electricity -- as in, zero emissions. Truth is, Bitcoin mining is consuming far less electricity than electric vehicles, phones, televisions, washing machines, etc. Mining equipment does not require cobalt nor any rare earth metals found in electric vehicles, smart phone batteries, and other consumer electronics. As such, and unlike these other technologies, there is no slavery in the Bitcoin supply chain. There is no strip mining and environmentally destructive practices that leave large patches of earth uninhabitable.

There are real concerns with the environmental impact of modern technology and the morality of supply chains -- focusing on Bitcoin is demonstrably wrongheaded and hypocritical.

Disingenuous arguments aside, is there environmental impact from Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining, and if so, is the benefit of Bitcoin worth this environmental impact? Monetizing electricity \u00b6 Bitcoin mining directly monetizes compute power. If you have a cheap source of electricity, and access to affordable ASICs , then you can make money mining Bitcoin. This simple set of incentives is unlike any in human history -- the business of Bitcoin mining is pure engineering, literally revenue earned directly from engineering. All other businesses require indirect means of revenue generation, typically in the form of customers or clients paying you money. In this case, it's direct -- if you create and propagate blocks, then you earn money . Bitcoin miners have no clients, no invoices, no accounts receivable. They either mine blocks, or they perish. This unique set of incentives monetizes any and all electricity sources -- favoring sources that were otherwise not monetizeable. For the first time in human history, power need not be generated to support existing human settlements, but instead, humans are directly monetizing power for profit. This is why we're seeing off-grid mining, where the miners are finding and developing sources of electricity that are otherwise not monetizable to the existing grid. This includes flared gas, abandoned coal, and excess hydro, wind, and solar.

Imagine a small town forming around a hydro-electric powered Bitcoin mining facility. Tens of thousands of machines, and hundreds of jobs arrive at this location. A local economy forms, and for awhile things are good -- until there's a cheaper source of electricity and those same miners move.

It's easy to focus on the success stories, and there will be many, but what about the failures? Will mining not incentive reopening coal plants only to abandon them in far more reckless means than would have happened otherwise?

In practice, when inequality breaks the social order, stratifying a single society into multiple societies, this is clearly beyond a \"natural distribution\". Further, the destructive influence of this kind of cultural disintegration can most certainly be considered morally wrong (assuming the culture in question is better than its disintegrated parts). Inequality beyond a natural distribution is bad This claim is difficult to argue against. Obviously if income inequality grew beyond a natural distribution such that our civilization disintegrates -- this would be very bad.

The dark underworld; The chaotic fringe; Behold, the wasteland of rekt dreams and abandoned code. Fighting, Hashing, Surviving. The blood of martyrs cries out. Those who overcame death stand triumphant, for it cannot be otherwise. The game theory of Bitcoin is well regarded as positive sum and incentivizing cooperative behavior. It is a marvel of technology and economics, resulting in the most sound money the world has ever known. Yet this entire system sits atop an adversarial and zero sum competition known as mining. While mining can be better understood as decentralized payment processing, the market dynamics and incentives are a cutthroat zero sum game. Worse still, an iterative version of this game is negative sum. The bigger they are ... \u00b6 Roughly every ten minutes a new block is found (mined) which increases the total supply. Every 2016 blocks the network difficulty adjusts to ensure that the issuance is on schedule (one new block every ten minutes). And every four years the issuance is halved (the famed \"halvings\"). This may seem simple in theory, but in practice the difficulty adjustment means that miners are in direct competition with each other, and worse, the halvings make this a negative sum game. For example, Imagine a big mining farm which mines ~10 blocks per day (out of 144 daily average). They are profitable so they invest in their business, adding new fleets of machines in order to double their hashrate. Once the new machines are online, this big mining farm doubles their hashrate and mines ~20 blocks per day -- however, that means that the daily average went from 144 to 154. This results in a difficulty adjustment that brings the daily average back to 144. Despite doubling their hashrate, the higher difficulty means they're only mining ~18 blocks per day, and critically, all other miners suffered equally. After the halving this miner finds themselves losing money, ~18 blocks per day is not enough to stay in business. They shut the machines off. The daily average drops from 144 blocks to 126. The next difficulty adjustment will bring the average back to 144 (lowering the network difficulty). Immediately, other miners see an increase (as it's now less difficult to mine blocks). A miner that was receiving ~20 blocks per day would now be mining ~23 blocks. This change might cause the out-of-business mining farm to get back into the game. They turn all their machines back on, and sure enough, ~23 blocks per day -- until the next difficulty adjustment -- and then their daily average drops back to ~18, hurting everyone else in the process. The only chance for this beleaguered mining farm to have any hope of survival is if other miners drop out first. They take out loans, and relocate to find cheaper energy. And in all their desperate moves, are they prepared for the next halving? What about the next generation of mining machines? Will they take out even more loans? The easier they fall \u00b6 Unlike gold mining, Bitcoin miners are in constant and direct competition with each other, such that the fortune of one will come at the expense of all others. And hurting one miner will directly benefit all other miners. Miners that succeed will find their profits dwindle over time even as overall mining revenue grows. Reserves will be tested and depleted as more and more competition enters the space. And there will always be more. Such is the nature of any zero sum adversarial game. On one hand, this benefits decentralization, as any attempt to monopolize mining will result in inevitable attack and disintegration, and the cost of bureaucratic overhead will make the larger miners suffer most. Mining, even if the value of Bitcoin was stable, is like a continuous arbitrage opportunity (finding cheap enough electricity to power advanced enough machines), with profits that inevitably diminish through competition. This forces miners into survival mode, and as the weak miners fail this will tip the surviving miners into a moment of increased profitability, which will attract more entrepreneurs and the cycle repeats, forever. Unlike saving in Bitcoin, which encourages low time preference long-term thinking, mining is a high time-preference, high risk game. Is such a cutthroat adversarial zero sum game sustainable? For an individual miner, the answer is no. However, as long as people are able and willing to try their hand at this competitive game, then it will continue. Ugly and embattled, will it be sufficient? Time will tell. The tower of good intentions \u00b6 Most worrisome of all, is not the bad actors, but the good-intentioned and honest miners. Honest and good-intentioned miners would not break consensus rules but for their own survival might ally into a monopoly and comply with regulatory agencies, ignoring blocks from other miners (the \"bad\" miners), controlling the mempool and transaction fees. With this level of control, a good intentioned monopoly would be the downfall of Bitcoin's decentralization.

The dark underworld; The chaotic fringe; Behold, the wasteland of rekt dreams and abandoned code. Fighting, Hashing, Surviving. The blood of martyrs cries out. Those who overcame death stand triumphant, for it cannot be otherwise. The game theory of Bitcoin is well regarded as positive sum and incentivizing cooperative behavior. It is a marvel of technology and economics, resulting in the most sound money the world has ever known. Yet this entire system sits atop an adversarial and zero sum competition known as mining. While mining can be better understood as decentralized payment processing, the market dynamics and incentives are a cutthroat zero sum game. Worse still, an iterative version of this game is negative sum.","title":"Mining is Negative Sum"},{"location":"criticisms/mining-zero-sum/#the-bigger-they-are","text":"Roughly every ten minutes a new block is found (mined) which increases the total supply. Every 2016 blocks the network difficulty adjusts to ensure that the issuance is on schedule (one new block every ten minutes). And every four years the issuance is halved (the famed \"halvings\"). This may seem simple in theory, but in practice the difficulty adjustment means that miners are in direct competition with each other, and worse, the halvings make this a negative sum game. For example, Imagine a big mining farm which mines ~10 blocks per day (out of 144 daily average). They are profitable so they invest in their business, adding new fleets of machines in order to double their hashrate. Once the new machines are online, this big mining farm doubles their hashrate and mines ~20 blocks per day -- however, that means that the daily average went from 144 to 154. This results in a difficulty adjustment that brings the daily average back to 144. Despite doubling their hashrate, the higher difficulty means they're only mining ~18 blocks per day, and critically, all other miners suffered equally. After the halving this miner finds themselves losing money, ~18 blocks per day is not enough to stay in business. They shut the machines off. The daily average drops from 144 blocks to 126. The next difficulty adjustment will bring the average back to 144 (lowering the network difficulty). Immediately, other miners see an increase (as it's now less difficult to mine blocks). A miner that was receiving ~20 blocks per day would now be mining ~23 blocks. This change might cause the out-of-business mining farm to get back into the game. They turn all their machines back on, and sure enough, ~23 blocks per day -- until the next difficulty adjustment -- and then their daily average drops back to ~18, hurting everyone else in the process. The only chance for this beleaguered mining farm to have any hope of survival is if other miners drop out first. They take out loans, and relocate to find cheaper energy. And in all their desperate moves, are they prepared for the next halving? What about the next generation of mining machines? Will they take out even more loans?","title":"The bigger they are ..."},{"location":"criticisms/mining-zero-sum/#the-easier-they-fall","text":"Unlike gold mining, Bitcoin miners are in constant and direct competition with each other, such that the fortune of one will come at the expense of all others. And hurting one miner will directly benefit all other miners. Miners that succeed will find their profits dwindle over time even as overall mining revenue grows. Reserves will be tested and depleted as more and more competition enters the space. And there will always be more. Such is the nature of any zero sum adversarial game. On one hand, this benefits decentralization, as any attempt to monopolize mining will result in inevitable attack and disintegration, and the cost of bureaucratic overhead will make the larger miners suffer most. Mining, even if the value of Bitcoin was stable, is like a continuous arbitrage opportunity (finding cheap enough electricity to power advanced enough machines), with profits that inevitably diminish through competition. This forces miners into survival mode, and as the weak miners fail this will tip the surviving miners into a moment of increased profitability, which will attract more entrepreneurs and the cycle repeats, forever. Unlike saving in Bitcoin, which encourages low time preference long-term thinking, mining is a high time-preference, high risk game. Is such a cutthroat adversarial zero sum game sustainable? For an individual miner, the answer is no. However, as long as people are able and willing to try their hand at this competitive game, then it will continue. Ugly and embattled, will it be sufficient? Time will tell.","title":"The easier they fall"},{"location":"criticisms/mining-zero-sum/#the-tower-of-good-intentions","text":"Most worrisome of all, is not the bad actors, but the good-intentioned and honest miners.

As such, using Bitcoin is a choice, a choice in favor of a better future.","title":"True value of Bitcoin"},{"location":"pow/","text":"Proof of Work \u00b6 How Bitcoin is settled on the timechain (payment processing on the base layer), and how Bitcoin is issued (aka mining or proof-of-work hashing ) work in progress Here is an overview of the different levels.

Bitcoin is unlike any money the world has seen. It is unlike any technology or network -- there's really nothing like it in history. As a result, any attempt at explaining Bitcoin will rely either on imperfect metaphors, or novel technical terms. For example, the word custody is a misnomer, an anachronism from a simpler time when banks would custody your gold. In reality, there are no actual coins to custody. Bitcoin is pure information; information copied publicly in a cryptographic ledger. Everyone can have a copy of the ledger, and everyone can validate that the ledger is correct. And similar to how the Internet empowered individuals to share ideas with the world, Bitcoin empowers individuals to custody their wealth, and to do so in ways far more secure than any bank ever could. And because Bitcoin is money, there are many traditional metaphors (such as wallets , coins , and addresses ) that can be useful, but at the same time may lead to a great deal of confusion. Bitcoin is in a category all to itself -- the physical limitations of custody , wallets , coins , and addresses simply don't apply to Bitcoin. And thus to custody your Bitcoin, means something very different than anything you've thought about before Bitcoin. We will describe these imperfect metaphors and attempt to demystify them, and then discuss the more accurate technical concepts necessary for understanding the truth of Bitcoin and what it really means to custody your Bitcoin . Wallets \u00b6 In Bitcoin, the word wallet is a misnomer, possibly the most confusing metaphor in Bitcoin. The term wallet in Bitcoin can mean different things. It can refer to a collection of private keys, or invoice addresses, or UTXO sets, or as the hardware or software to manage any of the above. But a Bitcoin wallet is most certainly NOT a collection of your Bitcoin. There is no Bitcoin stored in a Bitcoin wallet. The traditional meaning of the word wallet simply doesn't apply to Bitcoin. The word wallet was used in Bitcoin because the original Bitcoin core client app would store private keys in a file named wallet.dat . Hot Wallet \u00b6 A hot wallet refers to any software or hardware that stores your private keys in a device connected to the Internet, allowing you to send and receive Bitcoin. If a private key is directly accessible to an online device, this makes it hot . E.g., if you have a Bitcoin wallet app on your phone that can send and receive Bitcoin, this is referred to as a hot wallet . Cold Storage Wallet \u00b6 If you store private keys offline, in a device never connected to the Internet, this is referred to as cold storage . There are obvious security benefits, and cold storage is the recommended approach for safe custody of your Bitcoin. There are many cold storage practices, and they follow a standard pattern, private keys are stored offline (e.g., in an air-gapped device). public keys can be stored in an Internet-connected device. for receiving Bitcoin, the public key can generate receive addresses, and verify transactions. for sending Bitcoin, the public key can generate an unsigned transaction , then the unsigned transaction is transfered to the air-gapped device, then the transaction is signed on the air-gapped device, then the signed transaction is transfered to an Internet-connected device, and then broadcast to the network. There are many variations of cold storage but they all adhere to the above pattern; sometimes with additional steps meant to increase security. E.g., using a seed signer, a private key is never stored in any electronic device, air-gapped or otherwise. Instead the key is generated from the seed phrase and used on a signing device only when needed (and discarded immediately afterwards). Wallets Demystified \u00b6 A Bitcion wallet is not a collection of your Bitcoin. Rather, a Bitcoin wallet is any device or procedure used to manage your private keys (necessary to send and receive Bitcoin). Keys \u00b6 Not your keys, not your Bitcoin. It is your Bitcoin keys that you custody. Specifically, you custody your private keys, usually by storing the seed phrase that can generate your private keys and their corresponding public keys. If you're unfamiliar with these concepts ( public key cryptography and elliptic-curve cryptography ), the purpose is that public keys can create encrypted information that can only be decrypted by the corresponding private keys . Or in the case of Bitcoin, public keys can create transaction outputs that can only be spent by the corresponding private keys . In other words, you can receive Bitcoin through your public keys (or rather, addresses generated by your public keys), and you can spend Bitcoin by using your private keys . A seed phrase is a list of words that encode a 256-bit number that can derive private keys and their corresponding public keys, as well as the addresses that can be used in transactions. In other words, it is a phrase (typically 24 words) that can be used to recover your Bitcoin. This process of deriving keys and addresses from a seed phrase is knows as Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) Wallets . Hierarchical Determinism \u00b6 In practice, Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) Wallets allow you to save a single seed phrase and use that seed to derive as many keys and addresses as you need. This could be as simple as a single account with a single key that you use only once, or this could be millions of accounts used by an instition, such that each account can generate its own keys and addresses. Brief History Early version of Bitcoin generated private keys and addresses randomly, requiring users to backup all of the private keys associated with any of the addresses they had used. HD wallets on the other hand can generate an unlimited number of private keys and addresses, or rather, an unlimited number of accounts, each with their own keys and address space. And all of those accounts, keys, and addresses can be derived from a single seed phrase. Keys Demystified \u00b6 Public keys are used to receive Bitcoin, and private keys are used to spend Bitcoin (by signing a transaction). A seed phrase can be backed up and is used to generate public and private keys in a predictable (deterministic) way, such that your seed phrase is the most critical piece of information to secure. Addresses \u00b6 A Bitcoin address is a misnomer, and when not understood properly can lead to a great deal of confusion. The word address implies your Bitcoin is located at this address. In reality, there is no address where your Bitcoin is located. There are only transactions, which have inputs and outputs, and the outputs are either spent or unspent. Transaction inputs are created from the unspent outputs of a previous transaction. And these ouputs are created using an address. This makes the unspent transaction outputs spendable only by the corresponding private key associated with the address. There are two types of addresses, receive addresses (also known as invoice addresses) and change addresses. Invoice Addresses \u00b6 Imagine you receive 0.006 Bitcoin to an address in your wallet. This will create a transaction with an output using your address. flowchart LR subgraph TX-1 direction LR subgraph in-1[in] direction LR a[0.006 BTC] end subgraph out-1[out] direction LR b[0.006 BTC] end end a --> b Now imagine that you send 0.001 Bitcoin to someone else (to an invoice address they sent you). It is tempting to think your original address now has 0.005 Bitcoin, but in reality your original address has nothing. The original transaction output is spent . When you send the 0.001 Bitcoin, this will create a new transaction with two outputs: flowchart LR subgraph TX-1 direction RL subgraph in-1[in] direction RL a[0.006 BTC] end subgraph out-1[out] direction RL b[0.006 BTC] end end subgraph TX-2 direction TB subgraph in-2[in] direction RL c[0.006 BTC] end subgraph out-2[out] direction BT d[0.001 BTC] end subgraph out-2a[out] direction BT e[0.005 BTC] end end a --> b in-2 --> out-2 in-2 --> out-2a b --> in-2 One output has 0.001 Bitcoin , and another with 0.005 Bitcoin (for simplicity, this is ignoring transaction fees). Your private key can access the output with 0.005 Bitcoin , and someone else has the private key to access the output with 0.001 Bitcoin . The output at 0.005 Bitcoin uses a change address . The original transaction output of 0.006 Bitcoin is already spent, and your Bitcoin is only available in the new unspent transaction outputs . These unspent transaction ouputs are known as UTXOs (see below). Change Addresses \u00b6 Here is a real transaction where someone spent 0.001 Bitcoin from a previous UTXO address that contained 0.006 Bitcoin . In addition to a transaction fee of 0.00007718 Bitcoin , there was 0.00492282 Bitcoin sent to a change address . Every invoice address has a corresponding change address , which as the name implies, is the change of the spent transaction output. Addresses Demystified \u00b6 An address is not a location where Bitcoin is stored, but is a number used to generate a transaction output (see UTXOs below). An invoice address (aka receive address ), is what you would use to receive Bitcoin. And when you spend Bitcoin (from an unspent transaction), any remainder will use a change address . Transactions \u00b6 Bitcoin is a protocol managing a cryptographic ledger, and this ledger is made up of ordered transactions . Transactions are ordered through blocks , such that a block is merely a collection of transactions. A transaction has inputs and an outputs. The inputs must come from one or more unspent outputs of prior transactions. The only exception is the special coinbase transaction, which is the reward given to whoever successfully mined a new block (thus it has no input from a prior transaction). Otherwise, all transactions are composed of inputs from previously unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs). flowchart LR subgraph TX-1 direction TB subgraph in-1[in] direction TB a[0.25 BTC] end subgraph in-1a[in] direction TB a1[0.25 BTC] end subgraph out-1[out] direction BT b[0.5 BTC] end end subgraph TX-2 direction TB subgraph in-2[in] direction RL c[0.5 BTC] end subgraph out-2[out] direction BT d[0.1 BTC] end subgraph out-2a[out] direction BT e[0.4 BTC] end end in-1 --> out-1 in-1a --> out-1 in-2 --> out-2 in-2 --> out-2a out-1 --> in-2 UTXOs \u00b6 As the name implies, an Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) is Bitcoin that has not been spent. The Bitcoin you custody will be in UTXOs. UTXOs represent the total amount of addressable Bitcoin at any given time. Every UTXO contains an address such that the UTXO can only be spent by the private key (or keys) associated with that address. Transactions Demystified \u00b6 Transactions are simply the movement of Bitcoin on the ledger, such that the entire supply of all Bitcoin can be accounted for. A transaction is simply inputs and outputs which move the balance of Bitcoin to different cryptographic addresses (accessible only by private keys). Blockchain \u00b6 The word \"blockchain\" is perhaps the most misunderstood and overhyped word related to Bitcoin. Next time you read an article on \"blockchain technology\" replace the word \"blockchain\" with \"magic\" and you won't have changed the article's meaning. blockchain or magic? All the data in blockchain technology magic is immutable and can be adapted for use in a variety of industries, including healthcare, supply chain management, and voting. A blockchain , like the name implies, is simply a chain of blocks. And a block is a collection of transactions. That's it. It's an implementation detail as interesting as a linked list . And if you consider it a distributed database, it is a slow and inefficient database. By itself a blockchain is not secure; it is as mutable as any other data; and it has none of the magic often associated with it (by those easily confused by the subtle differences between technology and magic). A blockchain offers absolutely no value to healthcare, supply chain management, or voting. Ultimately, a blockchain only makes sense in the context of a proof of work (PoW) consenus mechanism whose security comes from the considerable cost of work in the PoW. Proof of Work \u00b6 A typical blockchain diagram will look something like this, Each block has a hash. A block hash is a sha256 of the entire block itself (which includes the previous block hash). This is a cryptographic function that takes any input (in this case a block) and generates a 256-bit number as output. A block can be referenced by its hash as well as by block height (starting at 1). Here are some examples of actual block hashes: Genesis -> 00000000839a8e6886ab5951d76f411475428afc90947ee320161bbf18eb6048 100100 -> 0000000000020ee4806021c0b6e7b97d31df0c2fdbd0f6c3a7cb5883c7bc151f 200201 -> 00000000000000e510b96fcf03e27ad30f8d50e4cd4cb7cf4c06cf7ffb9add3e 300301 -> 00000000000000002887537d323675f79cc5eddce91b3c0dd433739cbfe9c823 700700 -> 00000000000000000000e55da58b378880e797f9f3e96811d3e64a2f801eed9a These hashes have a lot of leading zeroes, and as time goes on, the number of leading zeroes seems to increase. This is due to proof of work (and network difficulty increasing over time). There is a common misnomer that PoW involves solving a difficult mathematical problem. In fact, all PoW does is provide a verifiable block hash that is smaller than the current network difficulty. In other words, the hash is simply a number (a 256-bit number) that is smaller than the network difficulty number. This is why you see leading zeroes. The reason this is a proof of work is because generating a valid block requires massive amounts of work. A Bitcoin miner constantly adjusts a proposed block (see the nonce in the header) and generates a sha256 hash, essentially a guess. Every miner repeats this, over and over, until finally -- and by dumb luck -- the hash is smaller than the network difficulty. If the hash is valid (adhering to consensus rules) then the rest of the network will accept the proposed block. There is also a timestamp field in each block, meaning the Bitcoin network is also a distributed timestamp server. This allows the PoW blockchain to keep track of time. And due to what is known as the difficulty adjustment , the network will adjust the difficulty number in order to maintain a 10-minute average block time. The difficulty will adjust every 2016 blocks (roughly every 2-weeks; and 2016 reversed is 6102, a subtle reference to executive order 6102 ). This is why the PoW blockchain is more aptly known as the Bitcoin timechain . Timechain \u00b6 The PoW blockchain is better known as a timechain because it provides a chronological order to all transactions, creating its own time in the process. From the whitepaper , Bitcoin provides \"a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions\" . In other words, Bitcoin provides order that lays itself out over time; that is, we know the precise order of transactions, as well as the future supply of Bitcoin. We can predict with high accuracy what the Bitcoin supply will be at any point in the future (something you cannot do with gold or fiat). The timechain does not repeat. There are no circular paths in Bitcoin time. It is linear, keeping a pulse, a new block, every 10-minutes on average. Symbolically, Bitcoin is bringing order out of monetary chaos. What was once chaotic and unknowable (how much money is there and how is it distributed), is now knowable with Bitcoin in a true sense of the word order (order out of chaos). Blockchain Demystified \u00b6 A blockchain is a chain of blocks, nothing fancy nor magic. What changed the world was not the invention of a blockchain (something that already existed as far back as the 1990s ). What changed the world was the invention of Bitcoin, a distributed timestamp server with a PoW consensus mechanism and difficulty adjustment, giving us the most sound money to ever exist. Focusing on a blockchain as innovation is like focusing on how the Wright brothers invented a wing rather than manned flight; meanwhile Bitcoin is the invention of digital scarcity and a new form of money.","title":"Understand the Terms"},{"location":"saving/understand-the-terms/#understand-the-terms","text":"Bitcoin is unlike anything that has ever existed.

And all of those accounts, keys, and addresses can be derived from a single seed phrase.","title":"Hierarchical Determinism"},{"location":"saving/understand-the-terms/#keys-demystified","text":"Public keys are used to receive Bitcoin, and private keys are used to spend Bitcoin (by signing a transaction).

The word address implies your Bitcoin is located at this address. In reality, there is no address where your Bitcoin is located.

And these ouputs are created using an address. This makes the unspent transaction outputs spendable only by the corresponding private key associated with the address. There are two types of addresses, receive addresses (also known as invoice addresses) and change addresses.","title":"Addresses"},{"location":"saving/understand-the-terms/#invoice-addresses","text":"Imagine you receive 0.006 Bitcoin to an address in your wallet.

A block hash is a sha256 of the entire block itself (which includes the previous block hash). This is a cryptographic function that takes any input (in this case a block) and generates a 256-bit number as output. A block can be referenced by its hash as well as by block height (starting at 1). Here are some examples of actual block hashes: Genesis -> 00000000839a8e6886ab5951d76f411475428afc90947ee320161bbf18eb6048 100100 -> 0000000000020ee4806021c0b6e7b97d31df0c2fdbd0f6c3a7cb5883c7bc151f 200201 -> 00000000000000e510b96fcf03e27ad30f8d50e4cd4cb7cf4c06cf7ffb9add3e 300301 -> 00000000000000002887537d323675f79cc5eddce91b3c0dd433739cbfe9c823 700700 -> 00000000000000000000e55da58b378880e797f9f3e96811d3e64a2f801eed9a These hashes have a lot of leading zeroes, and as time goes on, the number of leading zeroes seems to increase. This is due to proof of work (and network difficulty increasing over time). There is a common misnomer that PoW involves solving a difficult mathematical problem. In fact, all PoW does is provide a verifiable block hash that is smaller than the current network difficulty. In other words, the hash is simply a number (a 256-bit number) that is smaller than the network difficulty number. This is why you see leading zeroes. The reason this is a proof of work is because generating a valid block requires massive amounts of work. A Bitcoin miner constantly adjusts a proposed block (see the nonce in the header) and generates a sha256 hash, essentially a guess. Every miner repeats this, over and over, until finally -- and by dumb luck -- the hash is smaller than the network difficulty. If the hash is valid (adhering to consensus rules) then the rest of the network will accept the proposed block. There is also a timestamp field in each block, meaning the Bitcoin network is also a distributed timestamp server. This allows the PoW blockchain to keep track of time. And due to what is known as the difficulty adjustment , the network will adjust the difficulty number in order to maintain a 10-minute average block time. The difficulty will adjust every 2016 blocks (roughly every 2-weeks; and 2016 reversed is 6102, a subtle reference to executive order 6102 ). This is why the PoW blockchain is more aptly known as the Bitcoin timechain .","title":"Proof of Work"},{"location":"saving/understand-the-terms/#timechain","text":"The PoW blockchain is better known as a timechain because it provides a chronological order to all transactions, creating its own time in the process.

In other words, Bitcoin provides order that lays itself out over time; that is, we know the precise order of transactions, as well as the future supply of Bitcoin. We can predict with high accuracy what the Bitcoin supply will be at any point in the future (something you cannot do with gold or fiat). The timechain does not repeat. There are no circular paths in Bitcoin time. It is linear, keeping a pulse, a new block, every 10-minutes on average. Symbolically, Bitcoin is bringing order out of monetary chaos.

This is because true randomness is surprisingly difficult to achieve on a computer. This is referred to as entropy , that is, a measure of randomness. For example, a fair coin flip is 1-bit of entropy; flipping two coins can offer 2-bits of entropy (4 possible outcomes). But if one of the coins is unfair and always lands on heads, then we're back to only 1-bit of entropy from the first coin. The goal of a seed phrase is to achieve the maximimum amount of entropy that would prevent anyone from deriving or guessing your seed phrase. Beware of Low Entropy A 24-word seed phrase is nothing more than an encoding of a 256-bit number (with a checksum at the end). If all 256-bits were the same, that is, all zeros except the checksum, then this would have very low entropy. The seed phrase would simply be, abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon art That's 23 abandon 's and 1 art Turns out this ridiculous 1-bit of entropy phrase was actually used before. You can recover this wallet and view the transaction history for yourself. For 2-hours in 2016 there was 0.3469341 Bitcoin stored with this key. Perhaps these transactions are part of a Steganographic puzzle, and this is the first entry into finding a hidden fortune. Or perhaps someone lost their Bitcoin because of low entropy. How to get High Entropy? In the above example, it took less than a second to discover a seed phrase protected only by 1-bit of entropy. How long would it take for 256-bits of entropy? 256-bits of entropy is difficult to fathom. You might hear \"centuries\" or \"millions of years\", but it's more like, \"beyond the age of the universe even with planet-sized super-computers powered by Dyson-spheres around every star.\" It's the same as flipping a coin 256 times. Not exactly a difficult task, but assuming it was a fair coin then this would get you 256-bits of entropy, and the odds of anyone guessing or deriving that exact 256-bit number is impossible (unless they watched you flipping the coin). It's like finding a needle in a haystack -- if the haystack was the entire universe, and also the needle was invisible. Numeric Base of Dice \u00b6 We usually deal with Base-10 (decimal) and Base-2 (binary). In fact, when we say \"bits\" we're referring to the length of a binary number. But we can represent a number in any arbitrary base. And this is important because one of the best sources of true random numbers is fair dice rolls. A common 6-sided dice can be used to generate a 256-bit number, but doing so can be somewhat confusing. You may try to map the numbers to binary but you'll find it's not so easy (1 dice gives you 2.5-bits of entropy). To be safe you could just map odd and even rolls to binary 1 and 0, but this requires 256 dice rolls and isn't very efficient. A better aproach is to use a Base-6 representation of a 256-bit number, which would require 100 dice rolls. This is the number of fair dice rolls necessary to achieve 256-bits of entropy. Alternatively, and my recommendation, is to use an 8-sided dice, the kind commonly found in role-playing games. A fair 8-sided dice roll has exactly 3-bits of entropy (meaning every 8-sided dice roll gives you exactly 3 of the desired 256-bits). With this approach you'll need 86 rolls to generate sufficient entropy for a seed phrase. 256-bits in other Bases \u00b6 Numeric Base length Description Base-2 (binary) 256 coin tosses Base-6 100 dice rolls Base-8 (octal) 86 8-sided dice rolls Base-10 (decimal) 78 780-Quattuorvigintillion Base-20 60 20-sided dice rolls Base-64 43 I-Ching Hexagrams Base-2048 24 seed words How to Ensure Fair Dice \u00b6 There's a strange phenomenon in the Bitcoin community where they insist on casino-grade dice; as if \"casino\" is an infallible authority on dice grading that we should trust our life savings with. Don't trust, verify If you're concerned with the fairness of dice, then you should verify your dice with a saltwater balance test . Whether using \"AAA casino-grade razor-edge precision dice\" or using the dice you got from a board game, a saltwater test can verify if the dice is balanced or not. Just saying \"Casino-grade\" is not a verification. In most cases, even a slightly unbalanced dice will still roll fairly, but it's recommended to verify that a given set of dice (casino-grade or otherwise) is balanced so you'll know it can generate the desired level of entropy. Saltwater Balance Test \u00b6 You'll find many examples online , mostly from dedicated communities around board games, RPGs, and gambling aficionados. God bless our fellow nerds. In practice, you simply need a cup of supersaturated saltwater . This just means the water cannot absorb any more salt and that your dice will become buoyant. In a clean cup, fill with clean filtered water Add salt, a lot of salt , and stir till the salt is fully absorbed in the water Keep adding salt and stirring until your dice becomes buoyant Once the dice is floating towards the surface you'll be able to test if it's balanced or not. Simply push the dice with a pencil or chopstick. Balanced Dice src An unbalanced dice will float upward favoring one side. It will be obvious. In practice this could be due to air-bubbles or inconsistent materials. Unbalanced Dice src Using this very simply technique you can verify your dice are balanced and can safely be used to generate high levels of entropy. You'll find the \"casino-grade\" dice offer no benefit over standard board game dice, and most importantly you'll have verified your dice. No trust required! Dice and Paper \u00b6 To really understand the security and ownership of your private keys, you ought to generate seed phrases by hand, with dice and paper. You will need to transfer the seed phrase to a secure airgapped computer and generate a checksum, however everything before that can be done by hand. I recommend using 8-sided dice that have been verified through a saltwater balance test . This will make the mapping much easier because an 8-sided dice corresponds exactly to 3-bits of entropy. Use the following chart to map each number to its binary equivalient. 8D dice roll 3-bits 1 001 2 010 3 011 4 100 5 101 6 110 7 111 8 000 Each number on the dice corresponds directly to its binary representation, except 8, which in binary is \"1000\" and so this is just the lower 3-bits of 8 in binary. Because an 8-sided dice maps perfectly into 3-bits, it is very easy to roll and record the entropy bits directly in binary. Write Dice Rolls in Binary \u00b6 Each word in the seed phrase is exactly 11-bits (2048 possibilities). And each dice roll will provide 3-bits. You'll want to keep rolling until you fill out all but the last 11-bit word, and 3-bits of the 24th word. As you fill out 3-bits at a time, you can go left-to-right and top-down, and stop after writing 3-bits into the 24th word. The remaining 8-bits of the final word are calculated through a checksum which we'll discuss next. What about 12-Word Seeds? You could also do 12-word seeds, which will give you 128-bits of entropy. You'll fill out 11 of the 11-bit words and 7-bits of the 12th word. The remaining 4-bits will be the checksum. In either case, you'll need to compute the checksum to arrive at a valid final word. This simple checksum is to ensure that you've got a valid seed phrase. A common approach is to add an additional passphrase to the seed words, like a 13th or 25th word, but not constrained to the BIP-39 word list. This passphrase can provide additional bits of entropy, and using a strong passphrase can easily add enough entropy to make a 12-word plus passphrase seed as strong as a 24-word seed. Complete the Checksum \u00b6 Completing the final word requires a checksum. In this case a sha256sum of the 256-bits of entropy. Remember the 24th word has 8-bits for the checksum, which should be the first 8-bits of the shasum.

This is because true randomness is surprisingly difficult to achieve on a computer. This is referred to as entropy , that is, a measure of randomness. For example, a fair coin flip is 1-bit of entropy; flipping two coins can offer 2-bits of entropy (4 possible outcomes). But if one of the coins is unfair and always lands on heads, then we're back to only 1-bit of entropy from the first coin. The goal of a seed phrase is to achieve the maximimum amount of entropy that would prevent anyone from deriving or guessing your seed phrase. Beware of Low Entropy A 24-word seed phrase is nothing more than an encoding of a 256-bit number (with a checksum at the end). If all 256-bits were the same, that is, all zeros except the checksum, then this would have very low entropy. The seed phrase would simply be, abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon art That's 23 abandon 's and 1 art Turns out this ridiculous 1-bit of entropy phrase was actually used before. You can recover this wallet and view the transaction history for yourself. For 2-hours in 2016 there was 0.3469341 Bitcoin stored with this key. Perhaps these transactions are part of a Steganographic puzzle, and this is the first entry into finding a hidden fortune. Or perhaps someone lost their Bitcoin because of low entropy. How to get High Entropy? In the above example, it took less than a second to discover a seed phrase protected only by 1-bit of entropy. How long would it take for 256-bits of entropy? 256-bits of entropy is difficult to fathom. You might hear \"centuries\" or \"millions of years\", but it's more like, \"beyond the age of the universe even with planet-sized super-computers powered by Dyson-spheres around every star.\" It's the same as flipping a coin 256 times. Not exactly a difficult task, but assuming it was a fair coin then this would get you 256-bits of entropy, and the odds of anyone guessing or deriving that exact 256-bit number is impossible (unless they watched you flipping the coin). It's like finding a needle in a haystack -- if the haystack was the entire universe, and also the needle was invisible.","title":"Appendix: Using Dice"},{"location":"saving/appendix/dice/#numeric-base-of-dice","text":"We usually deal with Base-10 (decimal) and Base-2 (binary). In fact, when we say \"bits\" we're referring to the length of a binary number. But we can represent a number in any arbitrary base. And this is important because one of the best sources of true random numbers is fair dice rolls. A common 6-sided dice can be used to generate a 256-bit number, but doing so can be somewhat confusing. You may try to map the numbers to binary but you'll find it's not so easy (1 dice gives you 2.5-bits of entropy). To be safe you could just map odd and even rolls to binary 1 and 0, but this requires 256 dice rolls and isn't very efficient. A better aproach is to use a Base-6 representation of a 256-bit number, which would require 100 dice rolls. This is the number of fair dice rolls necessary to achieve 256-bits of entropy. Alternatively, and my recommendation, is to use an 8-sided dice, the kind commonly found in role-playing games. A fair 8-sided dice roll has exactly 3-bits of entropy (meaning every 8-sided dice roll gives you exactly 3 of the desired 256-bits).

Whether using \"AAA casino-grade razor-edge precision dice\" or using the dice you got from a board game, a saltwater test can verify if the dice is balanced or not. Just saying \"Casino-grade\" is not a verification.

A common approach is to add an additional passphrase to the seed words, like a 13th or 25th word, but not constrained to the BIP-39 word list.

Self Custody (Self Sovereignty) \u00b6 To self custody means you personally secure your seed phrase and manage your own keys. This is the recommended approach and it is also the only way to properly secure your Bitcoin. With self custody you could decide that you'd rather die than give up your Bitcoin; that it will go to your children or else to no one. This may sound silly and rather extreme, but Bitcoin is the only asset in the history of the world where you can meaningfully accomplish this level of ownership. And you can accomplish this without lawyers or politicians. In fact, you can accomplish this even in opposition to lawyers and politicians (as well as churches or nation states). Can you say the same about stocks, bonds, real-estate, or any modern financial instrument? The closest you might get is a physical possession, a bearer asset such as gold bullion. But there is an important difference: with the use of force anyone can take possession of gold bullion (as has happened over-and-over throughout history), incentivizing the use of force to seize wealth. But with Bitcoin, use of force is far less effective. You can transfer your Bitcoin anywhere in the world. And in the extreme, you can take your Bitcoin to the grave. This subtle difference shifts the balance of power, aligning incentives with voluntary cooperation and not with force or fiat. With Bitcoin, you truly can be a sovereign over your own savings. Be a Sovereign over your own Savings Only Self Custody \u00b6 If you trust an institution to custody your Bitcoin, then it's not your Bitcoin, it's their Bitcoin. And no matter how secure their custody system, it will never be as secure as your own self custody. Not your Bitcoin An institution that holds \"your\" Bitcoin can use \"your\" Bitcoin as collateral for \"their\" loan. If they're particularly clever they can buy more Bitcoin with that loan, and if they're devious they'll create fractional reserve schemes. And if they go bankrupt do you really think you'll get \"your\" Bitcoin back? An institution with \"your\" Bitcoin can lock you out of your account. The governments in whichever countries the institution resides can freeze and even seize your funds. Perhaps your name was too similar to someone on a sanctions list, or perhaps your government is in a dispute with another government and they suspend your account. A hacker who learned your mother's maiden name may be able to withdraw \"your\" Bitcoin. Perhaps one of the many data breaches resulted in your personal information leaking out, putting \"your\" Bitcoin at risk, through the fault of the very institutions trusted to secure your information. It's Easy \u00b6 There's a common misconception that Bitcoin self custody is hard. In practice, saving in Bitcoin is as easy as changing a light-bulb, and it is vastly easier than online banking, not to mention far more secure. Bitcoin is as secure as you want it to be, from trivial to nuclear-launch-code level of security. Bitcoin is hard? Compared to what?! Let's look at the security setup for accessing a typical online banking service, and determine how easy and secure things really are. Typical Online Banking The bank requires a \"strong password\", the kind recommended by security experts. You use a Password Manager to generate \"strong passwords\", and your online banking password is something like CH\"sgK9'?f<WZWYS . The bank requires multi-factor authentication (MFA), and you've been told by security experts not to rely on SMS text messages for MFA, so you install an IdP app, which requires its own password with optional biometric verification. You generate another \"strong password\" for your IdP app, this one is DVqt*\\Hax2$YD5vK . The bank asks for your email address and asks you to verify it. You realize your email can be used to reset passwords, and fortunately you've already enabled MFA for your email service and used a \"strong password\", which is c9~%C8UMNp+ung9= . The bank also requires AML/KYC, so you provide them copies of your passport and you upload an image of yourself holding your passport along with a piece of paper that has your written signature and today's date. You feel stupid sending your bank a selfie, but you do it anyway. The bank also asks you to select and answer three \"security questions\", and you go with your high-school mascot, name of your first pet, and the city you met your significant other ( Cherokees, Rex, Hoboken ). The password manager also requires its own \"strong password\" and in case you forget that one, they provide you a \"secret key\" that they recommend you print out and keep someplace safe. This \"secret key\" they tell you, can be used to recover all of your passwords, so you have to keep it very safe. You write down the following on a piece of paper, 6QRDjV7MmznW63yjZWM5c8ngC5rxQhZxAPXrzfuYbg8CZuLT and you put that paper in a fire-proof lockbox. We could keep going with this all-too-common tale of security theater (and you've no doubt already experienced much of this), but let's pause here and analyze how easy and how secure this system really is -- Security Review In practice, your personal information has certainly been leaked out to the dark web multiple times (through any one of the high-profile data breaches that you read about in the news). Tying your wealth to personal information is generally a bad idea, but impossible to avoid with institutional custody. A fire-proof lockbox would not preserve a piece of paper through a house fire. Regardless, there's a much bigger problem -- a barely competent hacker could call your bank and impersonate you. With a quick glance at your social media, they could answer the security questions ( Cherokees, Rex, Hoboken ), then they reset the password, change the security questions, liquidate the account, and finally they close the account. If this happens, you'll find yourself locked out of your own account, and after weeks of calling the bank and getting a lawyer involved you will eventually learn what happened. Your account was liquidated. The bank assumes no responsibility, and they give you the number for the FBI. They blame the whole ordeal on your weak security questions and point to the terms and services that you signed (but never read). In case it's not obvious, online banking is vastly more complicated than anything you'll encounter with Bitcoin. And you'll find all the same cryptographic concepts, such as private keys and recovery seeds , but the bank and apps will apply them in comically useless ways that add no real security and still manage to leave you vulnerable. No reasonable person would conclude that the current state of online security is easy. Securing your identity across disparate technology and banking providers is not easy. And worse, it is getting harder and harder by the day. But is Bitcoin really as easy as changing a light-bulb? Yes, and definitely easier than the security theater of online banking. Bitcoin is new and can seem complicated. But imagine asking a person from the middle ages to change a light bulb. They'd be confused and without explicit instructions they would probably electrocute themselves. Bitcoin is no different. Future generations may laugh at us for being so hopelessly ignorant of what will seem obvious and intuitive to them. Really, It's Easy \u00b6 Securing your assets in the traditional fiat banking system requires a Rube-Goldberg-Machine of security-theater where telling a call-center operator in the Philipines your mother's maiden name somehow constitutes security. Bitcoin self custody offers real security. And thus the risk of losing your funds in traditional banking is far higher than any reasonable self custody solution. Sounds like banking. Why would I want to be a bank? You don't, and that's the point. Bitcoin allows superior custody services that no bank or institution will ever be able to match. You secure your own wealth by securing a seed phrase. There's no bullion to protect, only information. A custody service must protect that same information while also allowing you access to it, which simply shifts the burden back onto you, adding unecessary complexity and vulnerability. Bitcoin self custody is exactly as hard as learning about the Internet in the 1990s. It's new, it's different, and it confuses those who haven't realized just how disruptive this kind of technology truly is. I heard it requires 'persistent competence', is that true? That's online banking you're thinking about. A redneck with a gun and a coldcard can protect their Bitcoin with more security than any bank in the history of the world.

Level 1 -- typical home network with devices that can reach a Bitcoin exchange website The only way to get started with Bitcoin is to first get some Bitcoin. The experienced Bitcoiners will tell you \"don't leave Bitcoin on an exchange\", and while this is true, this remains the easiest and least-friction path to getting Bitcoin that is secured, somewhere. This is also an easy way to learn about Bitcoin: buy some on an exchange and try to use it! Advantages of an Exchange \u00b6 device agnostic -- because it's an online account, you can access the exchange from a laptop, smarthphone, or wherever Disadvantages of an Exchange \u00b6 it is not your Bitcoin -- it will belong to the Exchange, and they will let you access it at their whim (according to their terms-of-service and availability) it's much less secure than self custody -- it will be as secure as your login credentials (your password, MFA, etc) and the exchange's \"forgot password\" mechanism it requires strict KYC processes such that you lose all privacy and security that Bitcoin otherwise could have offered initial account setup can be difficult due to integrations and slowness with legacy financial networks (e.g., waiting to verify a checking account for ACH transfers) Despite the many disadvantages it can be very educational to setup an exchange account. You will learn about ACH and wire transfers and the lengthy waiting periods needed before fiat money can settle. Bitcoin reaches final international settlement quickly, and as a result it puts strain on the existing financial rails even for small amounts. Alternatives \u00b6 If you can acquire Bitcoin directly without an exchange then you may want to skip to level-2 . Here are some alternative ways to get Bitcoin (without an exchange). get paid in Bitcoin -- you know someone who is willing to pay you in Bitcoin directly trade with someone -- similar to above, you have something to sell and the buyer can pay directly in Bitcoin Bisq or localbitcoins.com -- useful for the privacy conscious, peer-to-peer exchanges which assume you are already on level-2 Azteco Dealer There are many alternatives , and ultimately it depends on your circumstances whether an online exchange is appropriate for you. Find a Reputable Exchange \u00b6 Not all exchanges are equal, in fact, most are downright scammy and poorly managed. Experienced Bitcoiners are not at all surprised when overleveraged \"crypto\" companies go bankrupt. Here are some criteria to look for when evaluating an exchange: Withdrawal support -- this is the most critical requirement; avoid any exchange that does not allow you to transfer your Bitcoin to your own self custody. Otherwise you have no Bitcoin, only an IOU. And importantly, selling Bitcoin for fiat (as a means to withdraw) is a taxable event in the US. Bitcoin-only -- if they offer other \"cryptocurrencies\", full stop, go to a different platform. This may seem extreme, but there are valid security concerns. The technology behind Bitcoin is non-trivial, and even a Bitcoin-only exchange will have serious challenges to overcome when building a proper custody and trading system. Exchanges that list Bitcoin as \"one of many cryptocurrencies\" are most likely scams and cannot offer the base level of security and identity protection that you will need. Future-proof -- a competent Bitcoin-focused company will build on top of Bitcoin: lightning integration, mining services, or other related products. Ultimately, a fiat-to-Bitcoin exchange will not lead to long-term profit, and any exchange not looking to the future should be avoided (as their short-term profits will likely be at your expense). No scammy yield products -- if they promise some % yield through some unspecified source, go to a different platform. This is not only a security concern but it's also very likely a future bankruptcy ending in you losing your wealth. Reputable Exchanges \u00b6 no paid nor influenced content -- all views are from personal experience There are only two exchanges I would recommend: River Financial \u00b6 River is a Bitcoin-only fintech with probably the most reliable and impressive tech stack. During bull markets you'll find many popular exchanges (coinbase, gemini, etc) will be unresponsive and unable to handle spikes in traffic, or they may have issues integrating with your bank, or any number of problems. Meanwhile, River has proven extremely reliable and easy to use through bull and bear markets. Swan Bitcoin \u00b6 Swan Bitcoin is perhaps the most Bitcoin-focused exchange in the world; and it seems everyone at Swan (at any level) is a Bitcoiner. Swan openly embraces and encourages self custody, allowing you to setup recurring buys that will transfer to your own custody automatically.","title":"Level 1: Getting Started"},{"location":"saving/self-custody/level-1/#level-1-getting-started","text":"Save Bitcoin using a reputable exchange (a small amount that you can risk losing).

Experienced Bitcoiners are not at all surprised when overleveraged \"crypto\" companies go bankrupt. Here are some criteria to look for when evaluating an exchange: Withdrawal support -- this is the most critical requirement; avoid any exchange that does not allow you to transfer your Bitcoin to your own self custody. Otherwise you have no Bitcoin, only an IOU. And importantly, selling Bitcoin for fiat (as a means to withdraw) is a taxable event in the US. Bitcoin-only -- if they offer other \"cryptocurrencies\", full stop, go to a different platform. This may seem extreme, but there are valid security concerns. The technology behind Bitcoin is non-trivial, and even a Bitcoin-only exchange will have serious challenges to overcome when building a proper custody and trading system. Exchanges that list Bitcoin as \"one of many cryptocurrencies\" are most likely scams and cannot offer the base level of security and identity protection that you will need. Future-proof -- a competent Bitcoin-focused company will build on top of Bitcoin: lightning integration, mining services, or other related products. Ultimately, a fiat-to-Bitcoin exchange will not lead to long-term profit, and any exchange not looking to the future should be avoided (as their short-term profits will likely be at your expense). No scammy yield products -- if they promise some % yield through some unspecified source, go to a different platform.
