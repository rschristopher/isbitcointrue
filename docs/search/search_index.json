An essay One of my earliest reactions to a deep dive into Bitcoin, was the thought, It also fixes modern art? This is too good to be true. Politics and War Food and Health Education and Research Science and Innovation All of this has become broken, deeply broken, by fiat money, specifically monetary inflation. Bitcoin aims to fix this; to do what gold failed to do. Can it? All it would have to do is work. A truly scarce and yet infinitely divisible money. If it worked, then by its very nature it would obsolete fiat money and forever end monetary inflation, thereby \"fixing\" the intractable problems caused by fiat. For this to be true, it needs to be scarce, transmittable in any divisible amount. The latter is trivial, the ability of any digital money. But is it truly scarce? A centralized currency could be scarce. The USD technically could be scarce, but in practice it's not. For a centralized currency to be truly scarce it would need an incorruptible administration, something everyone could trust. One could imagine a sufficiently advanced intelligence, superhuman aliens, that create a secure centralized ledger that every human being can access, and that it's all based on a known finite amount. Why scarcity? Why not inflation? Why 21 million? Why a ledger? Why NOT a token? Why mining? Why proof of work? Why every ten minutes? Why every four years? Why not longer? Why not shorter? Why sha256? Why not a larger block size? Why lightning? Why not \"crypto\"? Why not NFTs? Bitcoin maximalism is the consequence of Bitcoin being true. Of understanding that it does in fact solve the economic problem of fiat money. But does it really? Is Bitcoin True? The consequences of fiat money run through the entirety of civilization, leaving almost nothing untouched, so are the effects of fiat money. The power offered by fiat is truly great, yet at a horrible cost. It benefits your present self while simultaneously hurting everyone else, including your own future. It does nothing to increase capital, but to redirect it outside of a free market, an illusion of control, that is, an illusion of power. It is a destabilizing parasitic evil that provides a temporary illusion of power. It prays on the weak and sinful. It gives them the ability to tax without the strength to impose such a tax. Bitcoin redeems, taking our sinful nature that inevitably leads to fiat, and turning into a force of good, defending the network. Miners are gargoyles, and their greed is protecting the sacred, the immutable ledger of a finite money supply. Shitcoins are not even attempting to solve the problem Bitcoin solves. They offer no scarcity. They are free market monies that operate as securities. They offer features because they're digital money, but without scarcity over time. Bitcoin is scarce over time, now and in the future. It will always be scarce, always. This is why the value will always increase with true economic output, savings will thus always be rewarded without the need of interest rates. Just a fixed savings whose value will increase in purchasing power. Meaning the quality of consumer goods will increase sufficiently to meet the demand. What would it have to look like to be true? Supporting Bitcoin means you are supporting a better future, where prosperity and human flourishing increase. The only way to devalue Bitcoin amongst Bitcoin holders is to reduce human flourishing, which by itself is non-sustainable, obviously because then we're talking about the elimination of human civilization. If civilization is to not only persist but to flourish, then Bitcoin wins. If Bitcoin is true, then it wins in the end, redeeming civilization in the process. Could an ideal money be inflationary? That is, if inflation is truly healthy, let's say, by whatever percent is an ideal annual growth rate of a given economy, then yes, one could increase the block reward such that miners get paid more and not less, incentivizing future investments into mining. But why save? Because your purchasing power will, on average, never change. Prices may still decrease over time due to efficiency improvements as the larger economy grows, but nothing as dramatic as deflationary money like Bitcoin. Relatively stable prices over time would be an obvious advantage, and are the basis of much of MMT. Although in practice, prices increase under fiat, a decentralized alternative currency could potentially avoid those pitfalls. Ironically, the biggest threat to such inflationary money is Bitcoin itself. Why hold an inflationary asset when a scarce one exists? Bitcoin supply is fixed, meaning there is zero possible inflation, ever. The smart money will find its way to the hardest asset. The only way to do better is deflationary currency, money whose supply can shrink and never be recovered. So rather than 21.million, something that slowly decreases, say, to 18.million, and so on. But it can't be random or a source of centralization, no one would store wealth in something that might disappear for reasons that could never have been adequately prevented. And the total supply can't disappear, but the total supply could be reduced without end, so long as the remaining supply is infinitely divisible. That is, if only 1 Bitcoin still existed. Or only 1 Satoshi... If, in this hypothetical 1.sat economy, someone discovers keys to an entire Bitcoin. Well, that is now an inflationary event. Increasing the money supply, and at the benefit of those nearest to the new supply. The biggest threat to Bitcoin is not lost keys but rather found keys that were once believed to have been lost. The damages of such an inflationary event are the very damages of fiat itself. The only better version of Bitcoin is one where \"lost\" coins are in fact known to be lost. Such a system would be truly deflationary in a provable way. Perhaps a future BIP will provide means to do so, but such a feat is beyond this author's current understanding. Perhaps a voluntary system where one can prove ownership but also that if keys are ever found, the funds are redistributed evenly across the network. Or a null account that destroys any Bitcoin sent to it? Such ideas have maddeningly difficult consequences and would not altogether solve the lost Bitcoin problem. How do I know it's truly lost? In a trustless system, I don't, not without verifiable proof. This means I will act as if Satoshi's coins are active, that they're part of the active supply, and that at any minute they will be used. In the 1.sat world, it is still operating under the assumption of a fixed 21.million, but only a tiny fraction of the supply is active in the market. The market in such a scenario must safeguard against the introduction of new sats, up to the max. The max is still known. So even in that situation it's better than infinite fiat. But, for this reason, Bitcoin can act as a truly deflationary money, but at a risk of inflationary events anytime \"lost\" coins are \"found\". A hypothetical zero inflation money, always 21.million and nothing ever lost, this would be weaker than Bitcoin, which is guaranteed to be deflationary as coins are lost or even deliberately destroyed. Yet this guarantee comes with a risk of \"found\" keys, that is, sudden increases in the effective money supply, cantillon bubbles that could be destabilizing. Bitcoin's cantillon risk. What is the ultimate fate of the USD? The USD used to be backed by gold. Roughly $20/ounce, then $35/ounce, then pure fiat backed by the US empire's agreement with Saudi Arabia. These are, by any measure, distinct monies, but all were known as USD. The fate of the existing post 1971 fiat USD seems obvious, as non-sustainable systems tend to.. well.. not sustain. And we're way past the point of no return. 80% of all circulating money was created in the last two years. True inflation, monetary inflation, is already in hyperinflation, despite a massive cover up and claiming it's all transient and that price inflation is unrelated to the massive monetary inflation. The willful stupidity of modern economists is startling. What is the effect of Bitcoin on USD? Unsure. Let's assume that the existing powers are failing, which seems to be the most likely scenario for their increasingly hysterical and incompetent behavior. Will they take the system down with them? Yes, if they could. Will Bitcoin adoption buoy the supply chains and free market remnants? Yes, it definitely could. The existing hysterical incompetence will try to take the system down with them, demanding unlimited power with no accountability for what any reasonable analysis would conclude as crimes against humanity. But they don't, and never had, real power. They are spokespeople for the masses, voices of the delusions. In the end, people want to eat, feed their families, be healthy, live productive lives that offer a future that is worth their present suffering, oh and of course not needlessly die in a gulag or concentration camp. Freedom is a necessity, and without it systems fail. This includes the current leaders. They can't but live in the world too, and act out their human desire for freedom and flourishing. What made civilization possible was not the systems of control, but freedom to live good lives, freedom and opportunity to build your own life, a life that is worth living. The idea that, \"it works\", is a strange lie when looking at the historical context. CCP? USSR? The best successful examples of controlled systems. They offered no innovation other than to parasitically feed from free market civilizations. An accomplishment that other controlled systems failed to replicate. Yet they repeat this lie. Why? Why repeat the lie? Because it promises power and the elevation of the systems of man as God. Creating ourselves a God. What we create operates within rules, natural laws. Bitcoin fixes this when adoption increases, not when it's USD price increases. Increase adoption of Bitcoin as money. Store of wealth, unit of account, system of exchange, ... Bitcoin's price in USD means very little. How about the relative percentage of total supply? Although by that measure it's a great example of a true inflation hedge. The timescale that shitcoiners operate on seems to be quite small. Such as claims that Bitcoin is not correlated with inflation. This seems absurd especially when you zoom out and see that Bitcoin is resistant to monetary inflation with the price benefitting the larger USD supply, as the additional money eventually finds its way into Bitcoin. And yet, it's so small compared to other assets. The price ultimately affects the demand curve, that's about it. It's benefiting from cantillon insiders buying Bitcoin, but until it finds stronger hands the true benefit may not be achieved. Another 10 years? Maybe! Year is not over. But it's almost over. Price is 49k, which is less than the 220k or whatever the fuck Max Keiser predicted. And now? What will 2022 have in store for us? There's a definite move towards totalitarian control, towards fear and slavery. Interest rates are up, inflation is soaring, and the price of BTCUSD is 40k... It seems the price is a reflection of the good, the people wishing to see a better future, a future of human flourishing. The getonzero idea is promising, although it's still fiat payment rails. Arguably cash is a better solution for purchases. Is Bitcoin True and how can you tell? How can you verify that it is true? The answers are usually to scoff and tell you to read the code. Well, okay, I'm a software engineer and can competently read code. But that doesn't mean shit. Yes, the code will at the moment be capped at 21.million. But how can I prove that this won't change in the future? One pull request away from a different max? Such a change would be a hard fork, which would break consensus rules, requiring a majority of mining power to agree on the larger supply. And the moment such a thing is possible, then it's now an inflationary money supply that might as well be fiat. You can't on one hand claim this isn't possible due to game theory while on the other saying that the masses don't matter. Let's not forget that the vast majority of the world's population fell into covid hysteria. Inalienable rights seemed to be easily discarded given this mass hysteria, why would monetary policy be different? As with covid, it's clear there exists bad actors that will always be trying to subvert and take power. Bitcoin will be under attack, forever. And they'll naturally play a long game, as with gold or really anything. This force of constant evil is a fact of life. Whether we like it or not, the so-called Bitcoin remnant, the Bitcoiners themselves, are playing a game (game theory after all) to influence and control the masses, to make sure that Bitcoin's fixed supply remains fixed. That there will never be more than 21.million. They are competing with the central bankers and the politicians and all those who pull the strings. And what if Bitcoin becomes controlled through whitelists? That only approved transactions on approved addresses become allowed, agreements with all major exchanges and miners. It would create a soft fork, and potentially a hard fork. Or rather, liquidity could be so severely impaired that it loses value. But unless this leads to updated consensus rules, the scarcity remains. Without Bitcoin as dark money, this creates a risk of a growing surveillance state, the beast. Store of value holders will carry the value into the future. Liquidity need only be roughly as good or better than the alternative value stores, perhaps real estate. This alone will prop up the value for generations.","title":"Is Bitcoin True?"},{"location":"is-bitcoin-true/#is-bitcoin-true","text":"Is Bitcoin True?
