# Is Bitcoin True?

One of my earliest reactions to a deep dive 
 into Bitcoin, was the thought,

> It also fixes modern art?!

More generally, Bitcoin
 -- *if it's true* --
 fixes the problem of fiat money.

## The problem of fiat money

Bitcoin was designed to fix the problem of fiat
 money, the problem of politics and money, 
 the deepest social and economic problem
 burdening human civilizations throughout
 history.

The implications of fiat money run deep, 
 beyond the ever-increasing
 price of meat and potatoes -- shaping
 Politics and War,
 Food and Health,
 Education and Research,
 Science and Innovation --
and yes, even *modern art*.

## Even modern art?

???+ warning "modern art under fiat"
    ![banana taped to wall](/images/banana.jpg)

    This is an actual piece of art -- 
    [that sold](https://news.artnet.com/art-world/maurizio-cattelan-banana-explained-1732773).

    There are many such examples, along with 
    eye-roll inducing apologetics to explain
    that the banana represents a critique of the
    very problems of modern art that everyone
    is criticizing.
    Janitors [protested](https://news.artnet.com/art-world/cattelans-banana-ignited-protests-among-miami-based-janitors-1731435)
    the banana for pay inequality,
    another artist ate the banana,
    and still another wrote "Epstein didn't kill himself" on the wall in red lipstick.

    Truth is, even the artists and the art
    dealers know that modern art is vapid nonsense,
    and so they perform self-referential pieces
    of art, criticising themselves, being
    cynical about cynicism --
    someone will then call the self-referential
    cynicism "genius" -- and why stop
    if the money keeps rolling in?
    
    Rather than ask *what is* and *what is not* art,
    instead ask how art collectors have money for this kind of art,
    and why they see value in it.
    And most importantly, 
    find out where that money came from.
    

## Where does money come from?

Money operates as a measure of value,
 subjective value based on the perceptions of
 those buying and selling.
 Money also stores value,
 value to be used in the future. 
 The time between earning money 
 and spending money
 is known
 as "saving". 
This simple and subjective sense of value
 is all that money is and ever will be.
It can be thought of as a technology,
 such that good money will be more efficient
 than bad money. 
It can be strong money with
 a fixed supply, or it can be easy money
 with an inflationary supply.
 
Inflationary money
 disprupts the natural cycle of saving,
 replacing the age old *"saving for the future"*
 with consumerism, 
 with credit and debt, 
 with a system of constant spending --
 because money that constantly loses value
 is simply worth more now than it will be 
 in the future.

Worse still, fiat money is inflationary by the whims
 of those who control the money supply. There is a
 reason janitors have less purchasing power than 
 ever before. And it's not because a wealthy
 person controlled this outcome.
If you are janitor earning fiat money, you will work harder
 and harder, but you will earn less and less value over time. 
 And that amount of value will be gained by those known as cantilion 
 insiders, those close to the money supply, those
 who benefit from increases in the money supply,
 including art collectors.

Ironically, an art collector's salary
 will also lose value over time,
 just like the janitor.
 However, assets, such as real-estate
 *and art* will increase in value. 
Inflating the money supply
 doesn't just drive up prices of consumer goods,
 it first inflates the value of hard assets, transfering
 wealth from those who work and save, to those
 who own hard assets.
And if you dig deep enough, you'll find
 that most art collectors don't actually
 earn a salary,
 never have earned a salary,
 and that their wealth is not
 stored in cash.

Political solultions make the problems worse,
 and over time those controlling the money
 supply use their ill-gotten gains (known as *seigniorage*)
 to control the politics (regardless of the system),
 so it inevitably becomes a rigged game
 (be it a democracy or theocracy or socialist dictatorship or otherwise).
Revolutions just change the faces of the problem,
 but like the word implies, a *revolution* is
 to move in a circle.

!!! warning "There is no political solution."

If you ever wonder why seemingly diverse modern societies 
 are all
 struggling with consumerism, environmental 
 catastrophes, health epidemics where supposedly
 "wealthy" populations are malnourished and
 dying younger, and fighting endless wars over
 control of oil -- look no further than
 the source of all this misery -- fiat money,
 where unaccountable bureaucrats control
 the supply of money at the expense
 of civilization itself.

While the current round of non-sustainable
 monetary parasitism began in 1971, this 
 problem is as old as time. Whether it's 
 causal or not can be debated, but societies
 fall when their money is debased
 (just ask the Romans).
 No reasonable person can believe otherwise.

The real question becomes, 
 what can be done about this problem of fiat money?



## The terrifying truth

*If Bitcoin is true*, it is almost too terrifying to contemplate.
 This would mean that all the problems of fiat money are 
 not only real
 but irreconciliable.
It would mean our entire system is built on lies, and that
 our leaders are parasitic sociopaths,
 unknowingly
 destroying civilization.

For Americans it means Nixon was worse than 
 liberals believe, and that
 FDR was even worse than Nixon.
 It means our media is pure propaganda,
 and that our political parties are nothing
 but the coordinators of this propaganda,
 anything that
 keeps you from ever asking,
> *where does money come from?*

This is a lot to take in for even a cynical person.
 You've been lied to about money,
 by people who aren't particularly competent,
 told that
 *money doesn't grow on trees* and then
 to look the other way when money is created
 from nothing;
 all by the whims of
 parasitic sociopaths that know
 not what they do.

It's tempting to believe their lies, either that
 *they* don't exist (it's all just a conspiracy theory)
 or to believe they're competent enough to
 actually control money.
But the terrifying truth is that *they* do exist,
 but are completely incompetent, so incompetent that they don't
 understand that one cannot actually control money,
 *no one can control money*, because
 money relies on the ever-changing perspectives of value of
 every person on earth.

!!! info "Money is technology"
    Money is the technology that allows for the ever-changing
    perspectives of value of every human on earth to be made
    known and measurable,
    that is, to have what are known as *prices*
    and *markets*.

    Money requires freedom, freedom to change your mind
    on a whim, to change your perception of value
    based on the ever-changing demands in your life.

One cannot control money without controlling the
 subjective values of every person on 
 earth, controlling not just their thoughts, but 
 their innate sense of value, and
 all the externalities that might cause them to react,
 rendering them less than cattle, 
 less than rats, 
 something more akin to cogs in a machine,
 a machine that is 
 controlled by -- *who exactly?*





## Bitcoin fixes this

This oft-repeated quote struck me as
 too good to be true, the wishful thinking
 of youthful idealists who are all theory
 with no real-world experience,
 those unprepared for the chaotic 
 realpolitik of life.

And yet, if what is claimed about Bitcoin is
 true, then it *should* fix
 the damaging effects of inflationary money.
 If the supply is truly scarce, 
 now and in the future; 
 and the network is truly decentralized, 
 such that no
 system of authority can control or kill it,
 then yes, logically, it would
 *fix* the terrifying problems
 of fiat money.

But like I said, this seems to be too good true.
 Like trying to contemplate what life would
 be like if people were always honest and 
 forthright; if everyone was kind, humble,
 and forgiving. People aren't always that way, 
 and it's not helpful to pretend otherwise.

But even so, I could never shake this question.

*Is Bitcoin true?*

How would we even know?


## Read the code
Many self-proclaimed Bitcoiners will scoff
 and tell you to *read the code*.

Yes, the code will at the moment fix the supply at 21 million.

But this doesn't answer the question.
 How can I know that this fixed supply won't change in the future? 
How do I know we're not one pull request away from inflationary money?
How do I know that the future supply won't 
 be controlled by incompetent bureaucrats?

Such a change would be a hard fork,
 which would break consensus rules,
 leading to a non-compatible blockchain.



## What if it turns out to be false?

... What then?

You'll understand money. 
The chaos of the moderm world will make sense.

You'll realize we need Bitcoin to be true 
 because there is no sustainable alternative.

.. this is the great filter, 
 and we may or may not make it.



## Why not other Cryptocurrencies?

Altcoins are not even attempting to solve 
 the problem Bitcoin solves.
 They offer no scarcity.
 Most are free market monies that operate as securities.
 They offer interesting features because they're digital money,
 but without scarcity over time. 

Bitcoin is scarce over time, now and in the future.
 It will always be scarce, always.
 This is why the value will always increase
 with true economic output,
 savings will always be rewarded without
 the need of interest rates.
 Just a fixed savings whose value will increase in purchasing power.
 Meaning the quality of consumer goods will increase
 sufficiently to meet demand.

> What would it have to look like to be true?

..Supporting Bitcoin means you are supporting a better future,
 where prosperity and human flourishing increase.

..The only way to devalue Bitcoin amongst Bitcoin holders
 is to reduce human flourishing,
 which by itself is non-sustainable,
 obviously because then we're talking about
 the elimination of human civilization.
 If civilization is to not only persist but to flourish,
 then Bitcoin wins.

If Bitcoin is true, then it wins in the end,
 redeeming civilization in the process.

All it would have to do is work. A truly scarce and yet infinitely divisible money. If it worked, then by its very nature it would obsolete fiat money and forever end monetary inflation, thereby "fixing" the intractable problems caused by fiat.
For this to be true, it needs to be scarce, transmittable in any divisible amount. The latter is trivial, the ability of any digital money.
But is it truly scarce?

A centralized currency could be scarce. The USD technically *could be* scarce, but in practice it's not. For a centralized currency to be truly scarce it would need an incorruptible administration, something everyone could trust.
One could imagine a sufficiently advanced intelligence, superhuman aliens, that create a secure centralized ledger that every human being can access, and that it's all based on a known finite amount.


## USD
What is the ultimate fate of the USD?
The USD was originally backed by gold. Roughly $20/ounce, then $35/ounce, then pure fiat backed by the US empire's agreement with Saudi Arabia. These are, by any measure, distinct monies, but all were known as USD.
The fate of the existing post 1971 fiat USD seems obvious, as non-sustainable systems tend to.. well.. not sustain. And we're way past the point of no return. 80% of all circulating money was created in the last two years. True inflation, monetary inflation, is already in hyperinflation, despite a massive cover up and claiming it's all transient and that price inflation is unrelated to the massive monetary inflation. The willful stupidity of modern economists is startling.

What is the effect of Bitcoin on USD?
Unsure. Let's assume that the existing powers are failing, which seems to be the most likely scenario for their increasingly hysterical and incompetent behavior. Will they take the system down with them? Yes, if they could. Will Bitcoin adoption buoy the supply chains and free market remnants? Yes, it definitely could.
The existing hysterical incompetence will try to take the system down with them, demanding unlimited power with no accountability for what any reasonable analysis would conclude as crimes against humanity. But they don't, and never had, real power. They are spokespeople for the masses, voices of the delusions.
In the end, people want to eat, feed their families, be healthy, live productive lives that offer a future that is worth their present suffering, oh and of course not needlessly die in a gulag or concentration camp. Freedom is a necessity, and without it systems fail. 
This includes the current leaders. They can't but live in the world too, and act out their human desire for freedom and flourishing.  
What made civilization possible was not the systems of control, but freedom to live good lives, freedom and opportunity to build your own life, a life that is worth living. 
The idea that, "it works", is a strange lie when looking at the historical context. CCP? USSR? The best successful examples of controlled systems. They offered no innovation other than to parasitically feed from free market civilizations. An accomplishment that other controlled systems failed to replicate. Yet they repeat this lie. Why?

Why repeat the lie?
Because it promises power and the elevation of the systems of man as God. Creating ourselves a God. What we create operates within rules, natural laws.

Bitcoin fixes this when adoption increases,
 not when it's USD price increases. 
Increase adoption of Bitcoin as money. 
Store of wealth, unit of account, 
 system of exchange, ...
