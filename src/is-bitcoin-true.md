# Is Bitcoin True?

One of my earliest reactions to a deep dive 
 into Bitcoin, was the thought,

 > It also fixes modern art?!

Bitcoin was designed to fix the problem of fiat
 money, the problem of state and money, 
 the social and economic problems that have 
 burdened human civilizations throughout
 history.

The implications of fiat money run deep
 into our society, beyond the ever-increasing
 price of meat and potatoes -- shaping
 Politics and War,
 Food and Health,
 Education and Research,
 Science and Innovation --
and yes, even *modern art*.

???+ warning "modern art"
    ![banana taped to wall](/images/banana.jpg)

    This is an actual piece of art -- 
    [that sold](https://news.artnet.com/art-world/maurizio-cattelan-banana-explained-1732773).

    There are many such examples, along with 
    eye-roll inducing apologetics to explain
    that the banana represents a critique of the
    very problems of modern art that everyone
    is criticizing.

    the banana,
    another artist ate the banana,
    and still another wrote "Epstein didn't kill himself" on the wall in red lipstick.

    Truth is, even the artists and the art
    dealers know that modern art is vapid nonsense,
    and so they perform self-referential pieces
    of art, criticising themselves, being
    cynical about cynicism --
    someone will then call the self-referential
    cynicism "genius" -- and why stop
    if the money keeps rolling in?
    
    Rather than ask *what is* and *what is not* art,
    instead ask how people have money for this.

    Find out where that money came from.
    


Money operates as a measure of value.
Money also stores value,
 value to be used in the future. 
 And the time between earning money 
 and spending money
 is known
 as "saving". Inflationary money
 disprupts this cycle of saving,
 replacing it with a cycle of credit
 and debt, a system of constant spending,
 because money that constantly loses value
 is simply worth more now than it will be 
 in the future.

Worse still, fiat money is inflationary by the whims
 of those who control the money supply. There is a
 reason janitors have less purchasing power than 
 ever before. If you are janitor, you can work harder
 and harder, but you will earn less and less value over time. 
 And that amount less will be gained by those known as cantilion 
 insiders, those close to the money supply, those
 who benefit from increases in the money supply,
 including art collectors.

Ironically, if an art collector earns a salary
 then their salary will also lose value over time,
 just like the janitor.
 However, their assets, such as real-estate and
 *art* will increase. Inflating the money supply
 doesn't just drive up prices of consumer goods,
 it inflates the value of hard assets, transfering
 wealth from those who work and save, to those
 who own hard assets.

Political solultions make the problems worse,
 and over time those controlling the money
 supply use their ill-gotten gains
 to control the politics (regardless of the system),
 so it inevitably becomes rigged game
 (be it a democracy or theocracy or otherwise).

!!! warning "There is no political solution."

If you ever wonder why seemingly diverse modern societies 
 are all
 struggling with consumerism, environmental 
 catastrophes, health epidemics where supposedly
 "wealthy" populations are malnourished and
 dying younger, and fighting endless wars over
 control of oil -- look no further than
 the source of all this misery -- fiat money,
 where unaccountable bureaucrats control
 the supply of money at the expense
 of civilization itself.

While the current round of non-sustainable
 monetary parasitism began in 1971, this 
 problem is as old as time. Whether it's 
 causal or not can be debated, but societies
 fall when their money is debased
 (just ask the Romans).
 No reasonable person can believe otherwise.

The real question becomes, 
 what can be done about this problem of fiat money?



## The Terrifying Truth

If Bitcoin is true, it is almost too terrifying to contemplate.
 It would mean that all these problems of fiat money are 
 not only real
 but irreconciliable.



## Bitcoin fixes this

This oft-repeated quote struck me as
 too good to be true, the wishful thinking
 of youthful idealists who are all theory
 with no real-world experience,
 those unprepared for the chaotic 
 realpolitik of life.

And yet, if what is claimed about Bitcoin is
 true, then it *should* fix
 the damaging effects of inflationary money.
 If the supply is truly scarce, 
 now and in the future; 
 and the network is truly decentralized, 
 such that no
 system of authority can control or kill it,
 then yes, logically, it would
 *fix* the problems
 of fiat money.

But like I said, this seems to be too good true.
 Like trying to contemplate what life would
 be like if people were always honest and 
 forthright; if everyone was kind, humble,
 and forgiving. People aren't always that way, 
 and it's not helpful to pretend otherwise.

But even so, I could never shake this question.

*Is Bitcoin true?*

How would we even know?


## Read the Code
Many self-proclaimed Bitcoiners will scoff
 and tell you to *read the code*.

Well, okay, I can competently read code, and read it far
 better than those who repeat this line.

Yes, the code will at the moment fix the supply at 21 million.

But  this doesn't answer the question.
 How can I know that this fixed supply won't change in the future? 
How do I know we're not one pull request away from inflationary money?

Such a change would be a hard fork,
 which would break consensus rules,
 leading to a non-compatible blockchain.

You can't on one hand claim this isn't possible due to game
 theory while on the other saying that the masses don't matter.
 Let's not forget that the vast majority of the 
 world's population fell into covid hysteria. 
 Inalienable rights seemed to be easily discarded given
 mass hysteria, why would monetary policy be different?

As with covid, it's clear there exists
  bad actors that will always be trying to subvert and take power.
 Bitcoin will be under attack, forever.
 And they'll naturally play a long game,
 as with gold or really anything.
 This force of constant evil is a fact of life.

Whether we like it or not,
 the so-called Bitcoin remnant,
 the Bitcoiners themselves,
 are playing a game (game theory after all)
 to make sure that Bitcoin's fixed supply remains fixed.
 That there will never be more than 21 million.
 They are competing with the central banks
 and the politicians and all those who want power over money.
But they're not competing over the code itself,
 they're competing over you, over whether you choose
 to play this game with 21 million fixed coins
 and no central control, 
 or whether you play their game,
 the fiat game where they make the rules and the money,
 you merely work at their pleasure.


## Why not other Cryptocurrencies?

Altcoins are not even attempting to solve 
 the problem Bitcoin solves.
 They offer no scarcity.
 Most are free market monies that operate as securities.
 They offer interesting features because they're digital money,
 but without scarcity over time. 

Bitcoin is scarce over time, now and in the future.
 It will always be scarce, always.
 This is why the value will always increase
 with true economic output,
 savings will always be rewarded without
 the need of interest rates.
 Just a fixed savings whose value will increase in purchasing power.
 Meaning the quality of consumer goods will increase
 sufficiently to meet demand.

> What would it have to look like to be true?

..Supporting Bitcoin means you are supporting a better future,
 where prosperity and human flourishing increase.

..The only way to devalue Bitcoin amongst Bitcoin holders
 is to reduce human flourishing,
 which by itself is non-sustainable,
 obviously because then we're talking about
 the elimination of human civilization.
 If civilization is to not only persist but to flourish,
 then Bitcoin wins.

If Bitcoin is true, then it wins in the end,
 redeeming civilization in the process.

All of this has become broken, deeply broken, by fiat money, specifically monetary inflation. Bitcoin aims to fix this; to do what gold failed to do.
Can it?

All it would have to do is work. A truly scarce and yet infinitely divisible money. If it worked, then by its very nature it would obsolete fiat money and forever end monetary inflation, thereby "fixing" the intractable problems caused by fiat.
For this to be true, it needs to be scarce, transmittable in any divisible amount. The latter is trivial, the ability of any digital money.
But is it truly scarce?

A centralized currency could be scarce. The USD technically *could be* scarce, but in practice it's not. For a centralized currency to be truly scarce it would need an incorruptible administration, something everyone could trust.
One could imagine a sufficiently advanced intelligence, superhuman aliens, that create a secure centralized ledger that every human being can access, and that it's all based on a known finite amount.

## So many Questions
* Why scarcity? Why not inflation?
* Why 21 million?
* Why a ledger? Why NOT a token?
* Why mining?
* Why proof of work?
* Why every ten minutes?
* Why every four years? Why not longer? Why not shorter?
* Why sha256?
* Why not a larger block size?
* Why lightning?
* Why not "crypto"? Why not NFTs?

## Bitcoin Maximalism
Bitcoin maximalism is the consequence of Bitcoin being true. Of understanding that it does in fact solve the economic problem of fiat money. But does it really? Is Bitcoin True?

The consequences of fiat money run through the entirety of civilization, leaving almost nothing untouched, so are the effects of fiat money. The power offered by fiat is truly great, yet at a horrible cost. It benefits your present self while simultaneously hurting everyone else, including your own future. It does nothing to increase capital, but to redirect it outside of a free market, an illusion of control, that is, an illusion of power. It is a destabilizing parasitic evil that provides a temporary illusion of power. It prays on the weak and sinful. It gives them the ability to tax without the strength to impose such a tax.

Bitcoin redeems, taking our sinful nature that inevitably leads to fiat, and turning into a force of good, defending the network. Miners are gargoyles, and their greed is protecting the sacred, the immutable ledger of a finite money supply.



## USD
What is the ultimate fate of the USD?
The USD used to be backed by gold. Roughly $20/ounce, then $35/ounce, then pure fiat backed by the US empire's agreement with Saudi Arabia. These are, by any measure, distinct monies, but all were known as USD.
The fate of the existing post 1971 fiat USD seems obvious, as non-sustainable systems tend to.. well.. not sustain. And we're way past the point of no return. 80% of all circulating money was created in the last two years. True inflation, monetary inflation, is already in hyperinflation, despite a massive cover up and claiming it's all transient and that price inflation is unrelated to the massive monetary inflation. The willful stupidity of modern economists is startling.

What is the effect of Bitcoin on USD?
Unsure. Let's assume that the existing powers are failing, which seems to be the most likely scenario for their increasingly hysterical and incompetent behavior. Will they take the system down with them? Yes, if they could. Will Bitcoin adoption buoy the supply chains and free market remnants? Yes, it definitely could.
The existing hysterical incompetence will try to take the system down with them, demanding unlimited power with no accountability for what any reasonable analysis would conclude as crimes against humanity. But they don't, and never had, real power. They are spokespeople for the masses, voices of the delusions.
In the end, people want to eat, feed their families, be healthy, live productive lives that offer a future that is worth their present suffering, oh and of course not needlessly die in a gulag or concentration camp. Freedom is a necessity, and without it systems fail. 
This includes the current leaders. They can't but live in the world too, and act out their human desire for freedom and flourishing.  
What made civilization possible was not the systems of control, but freedom to live good lives, freedom and opportunity to build your own life, a life that is worth living. 
The idea that, "it works", is a strange lie when looking at the historical context. CCP? USSR? The best successful examples of controlled systems. They offered no innovation other than to parasitically feed from free market civilizations. An accomplishment that other controlled systems failed to replicate. Yet they repeat this lie. Why?

Why repeat the lie?
Because it promises power and the elevation of the systems of man as God. Creating ourselves a God. What we create operates within rules, natural laws.

Bitcoin fixes this when adoption increases, not when it's USD price increases. Increase adoption of Bitcoin as money. Store of wealth, unit of account, system of exchange, ...

Bitcoin's price in USD means very little. How about the relative percentage of total supply? Although by that measure it's a great example of a true inflation hedge.

The timescale that shitcoiners operate on seems to be quite small. Such as claims that Bitcoin is not correlated with inflation. This seems absurd especially when you zoom out and see that Bitcoin is resistant to monetary inflation with the price benefitting the larger USD supply, as the additional money eventually finds its way into Bitcoin.
And yet, it's so small compared to other assets. The price ultimately affects the demand curve, that's about it. It's benefiting from cantillon insiders buying Bitcoin, but until it finds stronger hands the true benefit may not be achieved. Another 10 years? Maybe!

## Enemies
And what if Bitcoin becomes controlled through whitelists? That only approved transactions on approved addresses become allowed, agreements with all major exchanges and miners. It would create a soft fork, and potentially a hard fork. Or rather, liquidity could be so severely impaired that it loses value. But unless this leads to updated consensus rules, the scarcity remains. Without Bitcoin as dark money, this creates a risk of a growing surveillance state, the beast.
Store of value holders will carry the value into the future. Liquidity need only be roughly as good or better than the alternative value stores, perhaps real estate.
This alone will prop up the value for generations.
