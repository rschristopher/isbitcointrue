# Level 1: Getting Started

!!! info "Store Bitcoin (a small amounts that you can risk losing) on a reputable exchange."

The only way to get started 
 with Bitcoin is to first get some Bitcoin.
The experienced Bitcoiners will tell you
 "don't leave Bitcoin on an exchange", 
 and while this is true, this remains
 the easiest and least-friction path
 to getting Bitcoin that is secured, somewhere.
This is also the best way to learn about
 Bitcoin: buy some on an exchange and
 try to use it!


## Advantages of an Exchange

* it's easy
* device agnostic -- because it's an online account, you can access the exchange from a laptop, smarthphone, or wherever


## Disadvantages of an Exchange

* it is not your Bitcoin -- it will belong to the Exchange, and they will let you access it at their whim (according to their terms-of-service)
* it's much less secure than self custody -- it will be as secure as your exchange account itself
* it requires strict KYC processes such that you lose all privacy (the exchange, and various government agencies and regulatory bodies, will know that you have bought this Bitcoin)


## Alternatives

You may want to skip this step entirely,
 and indeed if you have means to acquire
 Bitcoin directly without an exchange
 then you may want to progress to
 [level-2](level-2/).
For example, here are some common ways
 to get Bitcoin other than through an exchange.

* get paid in Bitcoin -- you know someone who is willing to pay you in Bitcoin
* trade with someone -- similar to above, you have something to sell and the buyer can pay in Bitcoin
* Bitcoin ATM -- look for a non-KYC Bitcoin ATM near you
* Azteco Dealer --  look for a non-KYC Azteco Dealer near you

There are other options, and depending on your circumstances skipping an online exchange may be best for you.


## Find a Reputable Exchange

Not all exchanges are equal, in fact, most are downright scammy and poorly managed.
Experienced Bitcoiners were not at all surprised when many "crypto" companies went bankrupt.
Here are some criteria to look for when evaluating a given exchange:

* Must be Bitcoin-only -- if they offer other cryptocurrencies, full stop, go to a different platform. This may seem extreme, but there are valid security concerns. The technology behind Bitcoin is non-trivial, and even a Bitcoin-only exchange will have serious challenges to overcome when building a custody system. Exchanges that list Bitcoin as "one of many cryptocurrencies" are most likely scams and cannot offer the base-level of security and identity protection that you will need.
* Must not offer yield products -- if they promise some % yield through some unspecified source, go to a different platform. This is not only a security concern but it's also very likely source of a future bankruptcy.



## Reputable Exchanges

!!! info "no paid or influenced content -- all views are from personal experience"

There are only *two* exchanges I would recommend to a person who is getting
 started with Bitcoin:

### [River Financial](https://river.com/)

River is a Bitcoin-only fintech with probably the most reliable service on the market.
 During bull markets you'll find many popular exchanges (coinbase, gemini, etc)
 will be unresponsive and unable
 to handle spikes in traffic.
River has proven far more reliable and easy to use.


### [Swan Bitcoin](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)

Swan Bitcoin is perhaps the most Bitcoin-focused company in the world; and it seems
 everyone at Swan (at any level) is a Bitcoiner. Swan openly embraces and encourages
 self custody, allowing you to setup recurring buys that will transfer to your own
 custody automatically.
