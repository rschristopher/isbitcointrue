# Level 1: Getting Started

!!! info "Store Bitcoin on a reputable exchange (a small amount that you can risk losing)."

The only way to get started 
 with Bitcoin is to first get some Bitcoin.
The experienced Bitcoiners will tell you
 "don't leave Bitcoin on an exchange", 
 and while this is true, this remains
 the easiest and least-friction path
 to getting Bitcoin that is secured, somewhere.
This is also an easy way to learn about
 Bitcoin: buy some on an exchange and
 try to use it!


## Advantages of an Exchange

* device agnostic -- because it's an online account, you can access the exchange from a laptop, smarthphone, or wherever


## Disadvantages of an Exchange

* it is not your Bitcoin -- it will belong to the Exchange, and they will let you access it at their whim (according to their terms-of-service)
* it's much less secure than self custody -- it will be as secure as your exchange account (your password, MFA, etc)
* it requires strict KYC processes such that you lose all privacy that Bitcoin otherwise could have offered
* initial account setup can be difficult due to integrations and slowness with legacy financial networks (e.g., waiting to verify a checking account for ACH transfers)

Despite the many disadvantages it can be very educational to setup an exchange account.
You will learn about ACH and wire transfers and the often-times lengthy waiting periods
 needed before fiat money can settle. 
Bitcoin reaches final international settlement quickly,
 and as a result it puts strain on the existing financial rails
 even for small amounts.


## Alternatives

If you can acquire
 Bitcoin directly without an exchange
 then you may want to skip to
 [level-2](level-2/).

Here are some alternative ways
 to get Bitcoin (without an exchange).

* get paid in Bitcoin -- you know someone who is willing to pay you in Bitcoin directly
* trade with someone -- similar to above, you have something to sell and the buyer can pay directly in Bitcoin
* Bitcoin ATM
* Azteco Dealer

There are other options, and depending on your circumstances skipping an online Bitcoin exchange may be best for you.


## Find a Reputable Exchange

Not all exchanges are equal, in fact, most are downright scammy and poorly managed.
Experienced Bitcoiners are not at all surprised when overleveraged "crypto" companies go bankrupt.
Here are some criteria to look for when evaluating an exchange:

* **Bitcoin-only** -- if they offer other "cryptocurrencies", full stop, go to a different platform. This may seem extreme, but there are valid security concerns. The technology behind Bitcoin is non-trivial, and even a Bitcoin-only exchange will have serious challenges to overcome when building a proper custody system. Exchanges that list Bitcoin as "one of many cryptocurrencies" are most likely scams and cannot offer even the most base-level of security and identity protection that you will need.
* **No scammy yield products** -- if they promise some % yield through some unspecified source, go to a different platform. This is not only a security concern but it's also very likely a future bankruptcy.
* **Future-proof** -- a competent Bitcoin-focused company may (and arguably should) build on top of Bitcoin and offer lightning integration, mining services, and other related products. Ultimately, a fiat-to-Bitcoin exchange will not lead to long-term profit, and any exchange not looking to the future should be avoided (as short-term profits are likely at your expense).


## Reputable Exchangesa

!!! info "no paid or *influenced* content -- all views are from personal experience"

There are only *two* exchanges I would recommend:

### [River Financial](https://river.com/)

River is a Bitcoin-only fintech with probably the most reliable and impressive tech stack.
 During bull markets you'll find many popular exchanges (coinbase, gemini, etc)
 will be unresponsive and unable
 to handle spikes in traffic, or they may have issues integrating with your bank, or any number of problems.
Meanwhile, River has proven extremely reliable and easy to use through bull and bear markets.


### [Swan Bitcoin](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)

Swan Bitcoin is perhaps the most Bitcoin-focused exchange in the world; and it seems
 everyone at Swan (at any level) is a Bitcoiner. Swan openly embraces and encourages
 self custody, allowing you to setup recurring buys that will transfer to your own
 custody automatically.
