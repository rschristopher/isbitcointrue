There is a lot to learn to even attempt
 to answer the question *"is Bitcoin true?"*.
And in general, the best we have, is that
 we can't prove it false.
Maybe one day we will, and we'll realize 
 there was a fundamental flaw that everyone missed.
But until then, Bitcoin remains as true as anything we
 can know, making it the the hardest and
 most secure money in the world.

Ready to get started? But where to start?

Often times those curious about Bitcoin
 will find themselves overwhelmed by the
 many passionate and seemingly fanatic
 Bitcoiners.
These zealots (myself included) will overwhelm anyone new to Bitcoin
 with a firehose of information, including
 hard-learned lessons and important
 dangers.
Or we'll talk someone's ear off about 
 [Austrian Economics](https://mises.org/what-austrian-economics)
 or how fiat money is indefensibly immoral.
And yet, due to the 
 [curse of knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge)
 people new to Bitcoin will and should start 
 exactly where most experienced
 Bitcoiners tell them not to (i.e., keeping Bitcoin on an online exchange account).
The truth is, most all Bitcoiners started exactly this same way,
 and made many mistakes along the way.

Borrowing from the very excellent 
 [Zero Trust System](https://armantheparman.com/bitcoin-storage-get-better/)
 from 
 [Parman](https://armantheparman.com/about-contact/),
 I have outlined a series of levels to guide those
 new (and those experienced) towards a level of 
 safe self custody suitable for all levels of savings
 (from pocket change to generational wealth preservation).
The early levels start simple and can serve as a guide
 to avoid the many pitfalls and scams those new
 to Bitcoin will likely encounter.

As you progress, you'll also be learning practical
 knowledge that will allow you to safely and
 confidentaly store larger and larger sums of wealth.
At the higher levels, the extreme sense of ownership
 and the knowledge gained will burn away the
 initial skepticism that many start with.
In fact, I'd recommend to start with skepticism
 and keep in mind the following maxim,

!!! info "*The more one learns about Bitcoin, the more of a supporter one becomes.*"
 
Here is an overview of the levels along with 
 a rough guide on the amount of wealth
 appropriate at each level (that is,
 how much a reasonable person should
 feel comfortable with at each level).

* [Level 1: Getting Started](level-1/) -- store Bitcoin (only a small amounts that you can risk losing) on a reputable exchange.
* [Level 2: Your Keys](level-2/) -- store Bitcoin (still only a small amount that you can risk losing) on a home computer or mobile device.
* [Level 3: Dedicated Hardware](level-3/) -- store Bitcoin (as much as you'd be comfortable hiding under your mattress) on a dedicated offline device.
* [Level 4: Full Node Plus](level-4/) -- store Bitcoin (as much as you'd be comfortable hiding under your mattress) and run your own node with a dedicated online device for managing transactions.
* [Level 5: Airgap Quarantine](level-5/) -- store Bitcoin (as much as you'd be comfortable hiding under your mattress) with greater security than any bank ever could.
* [Level 6: Metal Backup](level-6/) -- store Bitcoin (as much as your house is worth) with metal backups that can survive a house fire and/or natural disaster.
* *pause* for [Wealth Preservation](wealth/), because at this level, you should also be thinking about other critical topics: *privacy, inheritance planning, and physical security*. Level 7 and above are use-case specific and not as universally relevant as the prior levels. At this point you can already store any amount of wealth (even extreme amounts of wealth) with more security than any institutional custody system could ever offer.
* [Level 7: Protocols + Multisig](level-7/) -- protocols to manage the complexity of self-sovereign savings with multi-signature keys.
* [Level 8: DMZs](level-8/) -- keep your full-node and transaction-manager completely safe from untrusted devices on your network.
* [Level 9: Fault Tolerance](level-9/) -- remove all "single points of compromise", in other words, an attacker who compromised a signing devices would have no access to your wealth.
* [Level 10: Fail-safes](level-10/) -- require fully redundant networks with explicit verification of cryptographic signatures.
* [Level 11: Countermeasures](level-11/) -- electronic countermeasures to begin to safeguard against "NSA-level" threats.
* [Level 12: Off-grid Operations](level-12/) -- Receive-only (e.g., satellite) nodes with offline transaction management requiring remote and geographically distributed key signing and redundant online drop-points (points to transmit).


Before you begin this journey and question everything you thought you knew about money,
 I recommend that you first read:
 [understand the terms](understand-the-terms.md),
 and [why self custody](why-self-custody.md).
