In order to save larger amounts of money,
 you'll want to setup a dedicated signing device.
Essentially, separatie the private keys from the public keys.
Public keys will be managed in a transaction manager.
Private keys will be managed in an offline signing device.

While there are many alternatives-- we will use
 [coldcard](https://coldcard.com/)
 as an example, but any offline signing device can be used.

## Transaction Manager

A transaction manager can be any device,
 although it's recommended to use a dedicated laptop
 that you can install a Linux flavor such as
 [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/).
You will still be using 
 [Tails OS](https://tails.boum.org/) on a USB drive,
 however, it's recommended to *also* install
 a Bitcoin client (such as
 [Electrum](https://electrum.org/#home))
 on the transaction manager directly.
You will use this client as a
 decoy or *honeypot*.
 


### Honeypot

A recommended approach




### Tails OS (xPub only)

Similar to [level-2](../level-2) we will use a
 bootable 
 [Tails OS](https://tails.boum.org/) USB drive,

## Hardware Wallets

Hardware Wallets
 can be a great self custody solution.

However, with the exception of devices like the
 [Coldcard](https://coldcard.com/),
 hardware wallets offer
 very different approaches to self-custody,
 are rarely Bitcoin-only,
 and they often
 involve proprietary software or hardware,
 with limited ability to verify entropy.
