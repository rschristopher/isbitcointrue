## Hardware Wallets

Hardware Wallets
 can be a great self custody solution.

However, with the exception of devices like the
 [Coldcard](https://coldcard.com/),
 hardware wallets offer
 very different approaches to self-custody,
 are rarely Bitcoin-only,
 and they often
 involve proprietary software or hardware,
 with limited ability to verify entropy.
