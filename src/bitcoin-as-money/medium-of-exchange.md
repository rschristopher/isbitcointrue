# Bitcoin as a Medium of Exchange

*Medium of Exchange* is simply the *currency*
 of money, that is, the movement of money in
 exchange for goods and services.

Buying a pizza or a coffee, selling
 a car, all are examples of using money as
 a medium of exchange.

This is an important area where Bitcoin has
 both a distinct advantage and a 
 perceived disadvantage
 compared to traditional forms of currency
 such as gold and silver coins.

As a digital money, Bitcoin is extremely
 advantageous in that it can be transacted
 anywhere on earth in any arbitrary amount.
 You don't need to look for exact change, and
 you don't need to mail a check. With Bitcoin
 you send a transaction and wait for final
 settlement.

And because Bitcoin is fully decentralized and
 trustless, this poses a significant disadvantage;
 you must wait for new blocks in 
 order to reach final settlement. This wait
 plus transaction fees makes Bitcoin
 seemingly impractical for buying
 a cup of coffee.

This is why Bitcoin offers a layered
 architecture, where final settlement
 is guaranteed on the base layer, and
 payment networks such as the
 Lightning network
 are built on top of the base layer.

You put your Bitcoin into a
 lightning channel, and can use that
 to buy coffee or pizza in a fast
 and highly scalable payment network.
Think of this as petty cash, like 
 spending from a gift card, only
 faster and with verifiable payments.

Meanwhile the base layer is used only
 for final settlement. And yet Lightning
 offers its own verifiable
 settlements. It can do this because
 it is built on the Bitcoin network
 as a 2nd layer, gaining the security
 and stability of the base layer.

Every Bitcoin on the Lightning network
 is backed by transactions on the base layer.
 The movement of Bitcoin on the 
 Lightning network
 simply shifts the balance between owners.

E.g., if you start with 0.5 Bitcoin
 on the Lightning network
 and spend 0.1, and separately
 someone pays you 0.05, then your balance
 of 0.45 Bitcoin can be closed out onto
 the base layer. Closing a Lightning
 channel requires a base layer transaction.
 In fact, if you have an open Lightning
 channel, you have a guaranteed transaction
 that could be made on the base layer to
 close that channel.
 That guaranteed base-layer transaction is
 why lightning payments can settle instantly.
 You start with a guaranteed 0.5 Bitcoin,
 and when you spend 0.1, your original
 "guaranteed 0.5 Bitcoin" transaction
 is replaced by one with 0.4 Bitcoin.

Lightning network is merely keeping track
 of the guaranteed transactions that could
 be made on the base layer. So while base-layer
 settlement is slow, waiting for 3 or more
 confirmed blocks, Lightning settlement is
 instant, and that instant settlement is
 backed by the guaranteed transaction
 that could be made on the base-layer.

In practice, the Bitcoin in the Lightning
 network, that is, the amount of Bitcoin
 in all Lightning channels, represents the
 circulating supply of Bitcoin as currency,
 as a medium of exchange.
