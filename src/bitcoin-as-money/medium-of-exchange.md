# Bitcoin as a Medium of Exchange

You often hear money referred to as *currency*,
 that is, the movement of money in
 exchange for goods and services --
 this is money as a *medium of exchange*.
Buying a pizza or a coffee, selling
 a car, all are examples of using money as
 a medium of exchange.

This is an important area where Bitcoin has
 a distinct advantage and a 
 perceived disadvantage
 compared to traditional forms of currency
 such as gold and silver coins.
This is also an area where fiat,
 for all its faults,
 has proven superior to gold and silver.
Simply put, using
 fiat payment rails for small purchases
 is often more usable
 than any alternative.
Importantly, this perceived advantage of 
 fiat as a medium of exchange hides
 the fact that those seemingly 
 quick and easy payments
 are sitting atop an outdated
 and painfully inefficient
 system of final settlement.

## Final Settlement

Money as a *medium of exchange* 
 for small payments is very different
 than final settlement.
Bitcoin is unparalleled in its ability
 to perform final settlement.
As a digital money, Bitcoin is extremely
 advantageous in that it can be transacted
 anywhere on earth in any arbitrary amount.
You don't need to look for exact change, and
 you don't need to mail a check.
With Bitcoin
 you send a transaction and wait for final
 settlement.
The ability to attain final settlement
 anywhere on earth in any amount
 and without any trusted intermediaries
 or authority is unprecedented, and is 
 why Bitcoin -- *if it is true* -- is
 the most superior form of money 
 to ever exist.
This is also why Bitcoin may ineventiably
 become the money of international settlement.

However, because Bitcoin is fully decentralized and
 trustless, 
 relying on transaction fees and 
 [block time](https://dergigi.com/2021/01/14/bitcoin-is-time/),
 this poses a perceived disadvantage;
 you must wait for new blocks in 
 order to reach final settlement. 
This wait
 plus transaction fees makes Bitcoin
 seemingly impractical for small
 purchases such as a cup of coffee.
Or rather, trying to achieve final
 international settlement for the 
 purchase of a cup of coffee is
 quite the overkill.

Neither gold nor fiat
 provide final settlement for a cup
 of coffee.
Gold lends itself to a system of credits
 and typically relied on a
 [bimetal monetary system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bimetallism)
 where silver coins acted as a 
 medium of exchange.
Fiat relies on outdated
 [banking cores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_banking),
 and in practice takes weeks or months for 
 something as simply as a cup of coffee
 to reach final settlement.
The exception to this is cash on hand,
 promissory notes, which
 reach final settlement
 the moment two trusted parties transact.
Cash payments are quite efficient but
 must be done in person, and require
 trust (trust in the fiat currency itself,
 and trust that the promissory note in question
 is not a counterfeit).

There is no known completely trustless
 medium of exchange, that is,
 not until Bitcoin over the
 lightning network.


## Lightning Network

Bitcoin, like the Internet itself,
 offers a layered
 architecture where final settlement
 is guaranteed on the base layer, and
 payment networks such as the
 Lightning network
 are built on top of the base layer.

You put your Bitcoin into a
 lightning channel, and can use that
 to buy your coffee in a fast
 and highly scalable payment network.
Think of this as petty cash, like 
 spending from a gift card, only
 faster and with verifiable payments.

Meanwhile the base layer is used only
 for final settlement. And yet Lightning
 offers its own verifiable
 settlements. It can do this because
 it is built on the Bitcoin network
 as a 2nd layer, gaining the security
 and stability of the base layer.

Every Bitcoin on the Lightning network
 is backed by transactions on the base layer.
 The movement of Bitcoin on the 
 Lightning network
 simply shifts the balance between owners.

E.g., if you start with 0.5 Bitcoin
 on the Lightning network
 and spend 0.1, and separately
 someone pays you 0.05, then your balance
 of 0.45 Bitcoin can be closed out onto
 the base layer. Closing a Lightning
 channel requires a base layer transaction.
 In fact, if you have an open Lightning
 channel, you have a guaranteed transaction
 that could be made on the base layer to
 close that channel.
 That guaranteed base-layer transaction is
 why lightning payments can settle instantly.
 You start with a guaranteed 0.5 Bitcoin,
 and when you spend 0.1, your original
 "guaranteed 0.5 Bitcoin" transaction
 is replaced by one with 0.4 Bitcoin.

Lightning network is merely a protocol keeping track
 of the guaranteed transactions that could
 be made on the base layer. So while base-layer
 settlement is slow, waiting for 3 or more
 confirmed blocks, Lightning settlement is
 instant, and that instant settlement is
 backed by the guaranteed transaction
 that could be made on the base-layer.


## Bitcoin as Currency

In practice, the Bitcoin in the Lightning
 network, that is, the total amount of Bitcoin
 in all Lightning channels, represents the
 circulating supply of Bitcoin as a currency,
 as a medium of exchange.

And importantly, despite the limitations
 of settlement on the base-layer,
 Lightning transactions
 are infinitely scalable, easily handling
 millions or even billions of transactions
 per second.

Lightning demonstrates the importance of
 a layered architecture as well as
 the importance of Bitcoin's continuous
 development.
Before there was Lightning, Bitcoin
 was simply not a viable medium
 of exchange. Now it offers the
 most advanced and scalable 
 medium of exchange that the world
 has ever seen.
