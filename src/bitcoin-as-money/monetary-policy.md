# Bitcoin's Monetary Policy


The following equation contains the 
 entirety of Bitcoin's monetary policy:

If you calculate the above summation, it is
 approximately 21-million.


???+ info "asymptotic limit"
    Technically, the total supply of Bitcoin
    will be capped at 
    [20,999,999.9769](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/38994/will-there-be-21-million-bitcoins-eventually/38998#38998).
    This is because there are only 32 halvings until 
     the block subsidy will be zero.
    
    If you were to replace the 32 with *infinity*
    the above equation would equal 21-million 
    as an asymptotic limit.




## Monetary Equation 

The equation (Bitcoin's monetary policy)
 breaks down as follows:

There are 33 block-subsidy eras (0 to 32),
 each lasting
 exactly 210,000 blocks.
This means each era is roughly 4-years,
 for a total of 132 years till the final
 Satoshi is mined.

Each era halves the block-subsidy, and
 after 32 halvings the subsidy would result
 in a number too small to represent in Satoshis,
 hence the subsidy will be zero.

At that point (block 6,930,000 in the year 2140), there
 will have been 20,999,999.9769 Bitcoin
 block subsidies, and from then
 on Bitcoin mining will operate only
 on fees (which in practice would have
 already happened as the prior era subsidy
 was already a single Satoshi).

## Supply over Time

### Difficulty Adjustment

...

Satoshi's greatest invention 

The higher the price, the more lucrative it is
 to mine Bitcoin.

Imagine gold jumped to $1,000,000 per ounce.
What would happen to the gold supply?
Would there be more mining?
Would the increased mining activity increase
 the supply and lower demand?

This is why Bitcoin is not and never was
 tulip mania.
Increase price of tulips led to a commensurate
 increase in tulip farming. 
Within six months the tulip price crashed,
 because tulips are not a scarce asset.

Increases in the valuation of Bitcoin do
 lead to more mining, yet those increases
 lead to a difficulty adjustment such that
 the increased mining does not change
 the supply schedule.
