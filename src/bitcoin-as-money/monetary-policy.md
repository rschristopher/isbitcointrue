# Bitcoin's Monetary Policy


The following equation contains the 
 entirety of Bitcoin's monetary policy:

If you calculate the above summation, it is
 approximately 21-million.
Technically, just shy of 21-million,
 that is,
 [20,999,999.9769](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/38994/will-there-be-21-million-bitcoins-eventually/38998#38998).
This is because there are only 32 halvings until 
 the block subsidy will be zero.

???+ info "asymptotic limit"
    If you were to replace the 32 with *infinity*
    the above equation would equal 21-million 
    as an asymptotic limit.

The equation (Bitcoin's monetary policy)
 breaks down as follows:

There are 33 block-subsidy eras (0 to 32),
 each lasting
 exactly 210,000 blocks.
This means each era is roughly 4-years,
 for a total of 132 years till the final
 Satoshi is mined.

Each era halves the block-subsidy, and
 after 32 halvings the subsidy would result
 in a number too small represent in Satoshis,
 hence the subsidy will be zero.

At that point (block 6,930,000 in the year 2140), there
 will have been 20,999,999.9769
 block rewards, and from that point
 on Bitcoin mining will operate only
 on fees (which in practice would have
 already happened as the subsidy
 was already a single Satoshi).
