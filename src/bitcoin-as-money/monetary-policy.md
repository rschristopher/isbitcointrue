# Bitcoin's Monetary Policy


The following equation contains the 
 entirety of Bitcoin's monetary policy:

If you calculate the above summation, it is
 approximately 21-million.


???+ info "asymptotic limit"
    Technically, the total supply of Bitcoin
    will be capped at 
    [20,999,999.9769](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/38994/will-there-be-21-million-bitcoins-eventually/38998#38998).
    This is because there are only 32 halvings until 
     the block subsidy will be zero.
    
    If you were to replace the 32 with *infinity*,
    then the above equation would equal 21-million 
    as an asymptotic limit. That is, it would
    take infinite time and infinite decimal places 
    to get to 21-million.





## Monetary Equation 

The equation (Bitcoin's monetary policy)
 breaks down as follows:

There are 33 block-subsidy eras (0 to 32),
 each lasting
 exactly 210,000 blocks.
This means each era is roughly 4-years,
 for a total of 132 years till the final
 Satoshi is issued.

Each era halves the block-subsidy, and
 after 32 halvings the subsidy would result
 in a number too small to represent in Satoshis,
 hence the subsidy will be zero.

At that point (block 6,930,000 in the year 2140), there
 will have been 20,999,999.9769 Bitcoin
 block subsidies, and from then
 on Bitcoin mining will operate only
 on fees (which in practice would have
 already happened as the prior era subsidy
 was already a single Satoshi).

## Supply over Time

One of the reasons Bitcoin's ledger can be
 referred to as a 
 timechain
 is because we know the future supply schedule,
 e.g., we know the final Satoshi will be
 issued in the year 2140.
This is an often overlooked point.
The issuance of Bitcoin is not dependent on
 its value.
Let's repeat that:

!!! info "Issuance of Bitcoin is not dependent on its value."

Imagine if the spot-price of gold or silver jumped
 up to over $1-million. 
That is, an ounce of silver would fetch more than
 $1-million.
You might go looking for old silver dollars.
And how do you think this would effect silver mining?

This is so fundamental as to be a law of nature.
Increased demand will result in more production.
And yet if Bitcoin price goes to $1-million
 or more, the issuance of new Bitcoin will
 remain on schedule.
Issuance of Bitcoin depends on time.
Let's repeat that:

!!! info "Issuance of Bitcoin depends on time."

What would happen if, tomorrow,
 the price of Bitcoin went up to $1-million?
Mining would be very profitable.
The hashrate would skyrocket.
And yet, issuance of new Bitcoin would stay on schedule.

Every 2016 blocks there is a difficulty
 adjustment to maintain a 10-minute average block time.
That is, if the average within those 2016 blocks
 is less than 10-minutes, 
 the difficulty will increase.
If the average is more than 10-minutes,
 the difficulty will decrease.
For this reason, while the time between blocks
 can vary,
 the average is (and always will be) 10-minutes.




### Difficulty Adjustment

...

Satoshi's greatest invention 

The higher the price, the more lucrative it is
 to mine Bitcoin.

Imagine gold jumped to $1,000,000 per ounce.
What would happen to the gold supply?
Would there be more mining?
Would the increased mining activity increase
 the supply and lower demand?

This is why Bitcoin is not and never was
 tulip mania.
Increase price of tulips led to a commensurate
 increase in tulip farming. 
Within six months the tulip price crashed,
 because tulips are not a scarce asset.

Increases in the valuation of Bitcoin do
 lead to more mining, yet those increases
 lead to a difficulty adjustment such that
 the increased mining does not change
 the supply schedule.
