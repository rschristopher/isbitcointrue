# Money and State

!!! info "There is no more important problem to solve in this era than the separation of money from state."

Power over money is power over human choice.
If a state had complete power over money
 then there would be no limit to that state's 
 power over those governed.
Controlling what people can and cannot buy,
 you would not need law enforcement;
 power over money would be sufficient enforcement
 of all human behavior and action.
Even crimes of passion would become quite
 difficult if one couldn't buy food or water or
 transportation.

Complete power over money would offer
 *total totalitarianism*.
Such power would render
 humans into something less than slaves,
 including those managing the money.
The system itself would become all powerful,
 leaving humans to be obedient
 (in action, speech, and thought) 
 to the monetary principalities that 
 emerge from their own base instincts.

Historically, such totalitarianism has proven
 impossible, collapsing under its own
 tyrannical fiat.
As monetary technology increases,
 so too does this monetary power.
The desire
 from the state and others to wield
 this power will also increase.
We can either limit technology to prevent
 this power from manifesting further,
 which puts our civilization on a dead end,
 or we separate money from state.

 


## Church and State

An often overlooked consequence
 of the establishment clause of the
 first amendment of the United States 
 is that rather than liberating politics from
 the corrupting influence of churches,
 the opposite was true.

!!! info "Churches, not politics, were set free."

This may run contrary to conventional
 wisdom, to the facade of enlightenment
 thinking that we arrogantly ascribe,
 but think about it: has the
 political class become less corrupt 
 as they separated themselves from religious
 institutions?
Or have the churches lessened their
 own corruption as they separated
 from the state, and become increasingly 
 benign places of worship?
There is much to be criticized when looking
 at modern churches, such as their
 shallow banality with no more sacredness than
 the strip-malls where they reside, 
 but the
 inquisition
 they are not.

To the degree a church has been separated from
 state, that church has been freed of the
 corrupting influence of the state.
It was state-controlled money that was
 the corrupting influence,
 not the church nor the state.
Separating money from human control, from
 oligarchs and autocrats, is the challenge
 we face.

!!! quote "I care not who controls a nation’s political affairs, so long as I control her currency"
    – Mayer Amschel Rothschild




## Human Nature 

One cannot separate human nature from religion
 nor from money.
There have been religions and money
 as long as there has
 been humans.
The concepts of a store of wealth, of
 scarce and beautiful artifacts,
 what we can call
 proto-money,
 have existed in every ancient culture.
Primitive forms of money are as universal as
 primitive, usually 
 animistic,
 religions.

???+ info "Fiat Money and Ancestor Worship"
    Look at the design of paper money and coinage.
    Founding fathers, kings and queens, and
    even the most secular and supposedly 
    "enlightened" money designs are ostensibly
    a form of ancestor worship.

    These animistic tokens functioned well-enough
    for primitive economies,
    but are being replaced by
    digital money, stripped of
    their animistic nature. 

    And rather than
    become a source of liberation, digital
    money has become a system of control, and
    not by mythological archetypes or even the
    pretense of a functioning religious system,
    but by mundane bureaucratic policy makers
    with unchecked power,
    parasitically feeding on the
    the people (people who don't
    even know the names of their
    would-be tyrant bureaucrats).


Religious beliefs, whether secular or traditional,
 provide a moral framework and a language
 with which to communicate what are
 otherwise transcendent concepts 
 (such as truth, goodness, or meaning in life sufficient
 to bear the weight of life's suffering).
We cannot escape religion, 
 just as we cannot escape money.

Without a functioning religious belief, 
 we inevitably fall into a 
 meaning crisis.
And without a functioning money,
 we inevitably fall into servitude and debt,
 and eventually into starvation.
We cannot escape the very human need
 for money.

But what we can do, is separate money
 from the state.
That is, to set money free from the
 corrupting influence of the state.
To once and for all end the corrupting
 power of seigniorage --
 to relegate money to its proper place,
 and not as a source of power and worship.




## Money and State

What is the ultimate fate of modern
 state-backed fiat,
 and specifically,
 what is the fate of
 the petrodollar system known as USD?
Of the hundreds of state-controlled
 fiat currencies;
 of the unprecedented
 hyperinflation
 events occurring around the globe;
 the lynchpin of this entire
 damnable fiat money experiment
 is the USD petrodollar.

???+ info "USD, a brief history"
    The USD was
    originally backed by gold.
    The very definition of USD was
    a measure of gold.
    It was worth roughly $20/ounce.
    You can still find "double eagle" gold coins,
    roughly one ounce of gold, with the words,
    "twenty dollars", printed very clearly
    on the front of the coin.

    In 1933,
    private gold was seized by the federal
    government through executive order
    [6102](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102).
    A twenty dollar bill was no longer a
    a "gold certificate".
    International settlements still happened in gold,
    but the USD was debased to $35/ounce
    (extracting wealth from the American
    people to pay off western war debts).
    Later, during the
    Breton Woods
    era (starting in 1944),
    the $35/ounce rate was guaranteed
    for all international settlements,
    which continued the legacy
    of the gold standard.

    The Bretton Woods system ended in 1971,
    with the
    [Nixon shock](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_shock)
    and shortly after, in 1974,
    the petrodollar system emerged.
    Fiat-funded economists proclaimed the
    USD price of gold would drop,
    thinking that this would remove the
    monetary premium of gold.
    And despite the opposite happening,
    despite wealth transfers from productive
    workers to cantillon insiders,
    despite grotesque abuses of power
    and corruption,
    despite continuous war in oil-rich countries,
    despite health epidemics brought about
    by inflating the price of quality food,
    despite all the evidence of how
    disastrous this system has been
    and continues to be,
    not a single person was ever held
    to account for this abject evil.
    USD remains a fiat money backed by
    an unholy alliance
    between the US and Saudi Arabia.

    These are, by any measure, distinct monies,
    but all were known as "USD".


The fate of the existing
 fiat USD (the "petrodollar")
 seems obvious,
 fiat systems tend to 
 hyperinflate into oblivion.
In the US
 we are at the brink of hyperinflation
 despite a shallow cover up.
Could Bitcoin adoption buoy the supply chains
 and allow our system to sustain?
It definitely could.
And despite authoritarian overreach,
 and dumb attempts at CBDCs,
 those in positions of power don't have,
 and never had, 
 real power over money.

In the end, people want to eat, 
 feed their families, be healthy, 
 live productive lives that offer a 
 future that is worth their present suffering, 
 oh and of course not 
 die in a gulag or concentration camp. 
Freedom is a necessity, 
 and without it systems fail. 
This includes the current leaders. 
They can't but live in the world too, 
 and act out the very human desire for
 freedom and flourishing.
What made civilization possible was not
 systems of control, 
 but freedom to live good lives, 
 freedom and opportunity to build your own life,
 a life that is worth living.

The solution to these problems of money and state,
 cam not be solved by the state.
There are no political solutions to problems
 born of political interventions.
The solution can only be a new form of money,
 superior to fiat money,
 superior to gold.
Bitcoin has all the properties necessary
 to be the solution.
And while this truth of Bitcoin
 may take several generations to fully prove out,
 there is no more important problem to solve
 than the separation of money from state.
