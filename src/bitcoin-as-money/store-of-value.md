# Bitcoin as a Store of Value

Most people first encounter Bitcoin
 as a potential *store of value*,
 a speculative gamble on future wealth.
They buy Bitcoin hoping to get rich.
And they rarely experience Bitcoin as a 
 [unit of account](unit-of-account.md).
This is not because Bitcoin
 is necessarily any stronger as a *store of value*
 than it is as a 
 [unit of account](unit-of-account.md),
 quite the contrary.

In the future,
 people will first encounter
 Bitcoin as a [unit of account](unit-of-account.md),
 that is, as *prices* in the market.
And if they participate in the market
 they will experience Bitcoin as a
 [medium of exchange](medium-of-exchange.md).
And then lastly,
 when they seek to save for the future,
 they will experience
 Bitcoin as a *store of value*.
This may seem odd and overly simplistic,
 but it is the inevitable
 conseuqence of Bitcoin being true.

Today, we approach Bitcoin somewhat
 backwards, starting with a
 *store of value*.
We do this
 because we live under fiat,
 and fiat is a terrible
 store of value.
The price of Bitcoin in fiat
 is extremely volatile,
 which is not a reflection of Bitcoin
 but rather the speculative
 nature of fiat-minded individuals
 desperate to play the fiat game.
In other words, they're trying to store
 value in fiat by buying and selling Bitcoin,
 trying to time the market,
 which does not *and can not* work.

The only way to store value in
 a fiat system is by rent seeking
 parasitism, such as buying houses
 with cheap debt and renting
 to people who cannot
 afford to buy a house.
A process that is as morally corrupt
 as it is unsustainable.

If you naively attempt to store value in fiat,
 it will lose its value over time.
If you need to move large amounts of fiat
 from one country to another,
 it will likely be confiscated or unjustly taxed.
This is because there are many competing
 fiat currencies and fiat voices (so-to-speak).
Fiat money is inextricably bound to politics
 and cultural norms.
It is afterall only an expression
 of those who speak it into power.

Simply put, fiat cannot function as 
 a store of value. This is why fine art
 has become so corrupted, why real estate
 and equities are over inflated.
People cannot store
 wealth using fiat money, so they seek
 to preserve wealth through other
 means, typically malinvesting
 (investing in index funds not as a priced risk,
 but as a malinvested store of value).
The only successful store of value under
 fiat is rent-seeking with privileged
 access to the money printer
 (to cheap debt).

Bitcoin, if it is true, is a superior store of value
 to fiat and even to gold
 (the most effective store of value the world has ever known).
Over time Bitcoin will gain adoption and value, 
 and it can be transferred anywhere on earth, unmolested.
Neither gold nor fiat nor real-estate nor even fine-art
 can function as a better store of value than Bitcoin.
