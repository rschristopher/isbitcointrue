# Bitcoin as a Store of Value

Of all the attributes of money, 
 it is as a
 store of value that most people first 
 encounter Bitcoin. 
This is not because
 Bitcoin is stronger as a store of value
 than it is as a unit of account,
 no, we first encounter Bitcoin as a
 store of value
 because fiat is simply a terrible
 store of value (literally losing value over time).

Of all attributes of money, fiat fails
 completely as a store of value. 
If you
 need to store fiat over time, it will
 lose its value.
If you need to move large amounts of fiat
 from one country to another, it will
 likely be confiscated or unjustly taxed.

Simply put, fiat cannot function as 
 a store of value. This is why fine art
 has become so corrupted, why real estate
 and equities are over inflated.
 People cannot store
 wealth using fiat money, so they seek
 to preserve wealth through other
 means, typically mal-investing
 (investing in index funds not as a priced risk,
 but as a way to store value).


Bitcoin as a store of value is plainly superior.
 Over time it will gain value, and it can be 
 transferred anywhere on earth
 unmolested.
