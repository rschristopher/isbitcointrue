# Bitcoin as a Store of Value

<!--

Most people first learn about Bitcoin
 as an investment,
 a speculative gamble on future wealth.
They buy Bitcoin hoping to get rich,
 thinking in terms of fiat money.
Later they might realize that Bitcoin's
 [fixed supply](fixed-supply.md)
 is a potential *store of wealth*.
But rarely do people experience Bitcoin as a 
 *unit of account* (potential or otherwise).
This is not because Bitcoin
 is necessarily any stronger as a *store of value*
 than it is as a 
 *unit of account*,
 quite the contrary.
As powerful of a *store of value* as Bitcoin
 might be, it is fundamentally a
 [unit of account](unit-of-account.md).

Digital scarcity in a trustless and 
 completely transparent network provides
 a global *unit of account*, and the
 clearest signal
 possible for price discovery.
It is a delightful side effect
 that Bitcoin is *also* a superior
 *store of value*.

In fact, Bitcoin's early adoption is being
 driven as a *store of value*.



## Encountering Bitcoin

In the future -- *if Bitcoin is true* --
 people will first encounter
 it as a [unit of account](unit-of-account.md),
 that is, as *prices* in the market.
And if they participate in the market
 they will experience Bitcoin as a
 [medium of exchange](medium-of-exchange.md).
And then lastly,
 when they save for the future,
 then and only then
 will they experience
 Bitcoin as a *store of value*.
Speculative gambles will still exist,
 including as priced risks known as "investments",
 but money itself is not a speculation,
 it is a *unit of account*,
 a *medium of exchange*,
 and a *store of value*.
This may all seem odd and overly simplistic,
 but it is the inevitable
 consequence of Bitcoin being true.

Today, we approach Bitcoin somewhat
 backwards, starting with a
 *store of value*.
We do this
 because we live under fiat,
 and fiat is a terrible
 store of value.
The price of Bitcoin in fiat
 is extremely volatile,
 which is not a reflection of Bitcoin
 but rather the speculative
 nature of fiat-minded individuals
 desperate to play the fiat game.
In other words, they're trying to store
 value in fiat by buying and selling Bitcoin,
 trying to time the market,
 which does not *and can not* work.
Similar things happened with gold price
 in the dying days of the Weimar Republic,
 the volatility of the gold price was
 not a reflection of gold, but of the
 hyperinflating money.

During the final years of the Weimar Republic
 the price of gold was extremely volatile.
Was this a reflection of the volatility of
 gold? Was gold failing as a store of value?
Clearly no, the currency hyperinflated 
 until it collapsed, leaving gold as the only
 store of value.
And only afterwards can markets emerge
 with proper price discovery.
The effects of fiat all tend to follow this
 same pattern, even USD.

The only way to store value in
 a fiat system is by rent seeking
 parasitism, such as buying houses
 with cheap debt and renting
 to people who cannot
 afford to buy a house.
A process that is as morally corrupt
 as it is unsustainable.



## Overcoming Fiat

If you naively attempt to store value in fiat,
 it will lose its value over time.
If you need to move large amounts of fiat
 from one country to another,
 it will likely be confiscated or unjustly taxed.
This is because there are many competing
 fiat currencies and fiat voices (so-to-speak).
Fiat money is inextricably bound to politics
 and cultural norms.
It is afterall only an expression
 of those who speak it into power.

Simply put, fiat cannot function as 
 a store of value. This is why fine art
 has become so corrupted, why real estate
 and equities are over inflated.
People cannot store
 wealth using fiat money, so they seek
 to preserve wealth through other
 means, typically malinvesting
 (investing in index funds not as a priced risk,
 but as a malinvested *store of value*).
The only successful *store of value* under
 fiat is rent-seeking with privileged
 access to the money printer
 (to cheap debt).

Bitcoin -- *if it is true* -- is a superior *store of value*
 to fiat and even to gold
 (the most effective *store of value* the world has ever known).
Over time Bitcoin will gain adoption and value, 
 and it can do this while being 
 transferable anywhere on earth, unmolested.
Neither gold nor fiat nor real-estate nor even fine-art
 can function as a better store of value than Bitcoin.
