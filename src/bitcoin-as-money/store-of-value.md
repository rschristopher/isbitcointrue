# Bitcoin as a Store of Value

Today, most people first encounter Bitcoin
 as a speculative gamble, more than a potential
 store of value, but as future wealth.

We don't first encounter Bitcoin
 as a store of value because
 it is strongest as a store of value,
 no, we first encounter Bitcoin as a
 store of value
 because we live under fiat,
 and fiat is simply the worst possible
 store of value
 (continuously losing value over time).

Fiat fails
 completely as a store of value. 
If you
 need to store fiat over time, it will
 lose its value.
If you need to move large amounts of fiat
 from one country to another, it will
 likely be confiscated or unjustly taxed.
This is because there are many competing
 fiat currencies and fiat voices (so-to-speak).
Fiat money is inextricably bound to politics
 and cultural norms, it is an expression
 of those who speak it into power.

Simply put, fiat cannot function as 
 a store of value. This is why fine art
 has become so corrupted, why real estate
 and equities are over inflated.
People cannot store
 wealth using fiat money, so they seek
 to preserve wealth through other
 means, typically mal-investing
 (investing in index funds not as a priced risk,
 but as a way to store value).


Bitcoin as a store of value is plainly superior.
 Over time it will gain value, and it can be 
 transferred anywhere on earth
 unmolested.
