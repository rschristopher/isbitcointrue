# Bitcoin as a Unit of Account

<!--
Lord Jesus Christ
Son of God
Have mercy on me a sinner
-->

This is the most important quality of money.
Don't let the benign name, *unit of account*, 
 fool you.
In the future this will be people's first encounter
 with Bitcoin, as a unit of account.

A unit of account is *-the-* measure of value,
 the measure of value that all human beings
 can agree upon such that our subjective
 and continuously changing perception of
 *value* can be rendered knowable.
In other words, this is the *price* in a market.

???+ info "Bentleys and Cristals"
    There is a peculiar practice amongst Wall Street types
     when dealing with large sums of money.
    
    This is because it's difficult to intuitively
     understand
     a "billion dollars", or hundreds of millions
     of dollars, let alone the quadrillions of
     dollars of
     unfunded liabilities tied up in derivative
     schemes.
    
    An investor may refer to
     Bentleys, or bottles of Cristal, as more
     convenient units than dollars.
    
    > I'm not going to sweat over this 50 Cristal client when there's 5 Bentleys on the other line.
    
    In this case Bentley and Cristal are being
     used in the abstract as units of account.




## Fiat as Unit of Account

Fiat money makes for a terrible
 unit of account.

This is because you must
 "adjust for inflation", or append the date, 
 or both.
And everything is relative with no absolute
 unit to measure against (not even bottles of Cristal).
It is all fiat all the time.

Fiat unit of account is like a ruler that arbitrarily changes length.
Like the imperial unit of length, the "foot" --
 it was historically based on the length of a person's foot.
Although in fairness at least the length of a foot
 never inflated to be larger than the earth 
 (inflationary fiat currency can make no such claim).

!!! example "this $20 gold coin cost $1500 last year, which should be $300 if adjusted by CPI, but right now it's $1900 because of *actual* inflation."



## Bitcoin as the Standard 

Due to it's fixed supply Bitcoin is a superior
 unit of account.
Interestingly, it operates as
 a potentially deflationary unit of account.
That is, goods and services
 could get cheaper over time as measured in
 Bitcoin. But only as a result of actual
 economic growth.

On one hand this presents similar
 math problems
 that we see with inflationary
 money,

!!! example "my house was 12 Bitcoin in 2019, which is now the price of the entire neighborhood."

The key difference is that any amount of Bitcoin
 is an exact fraction of all the Bitcoin that
 will ever exist. 
1 Bitcoin is
 1 out of 21-million, always.

It's like using real-estate as a unit of account,
 except it's fungible, infinitely divisible,
 and the value won't go down
 because of bad schools in your neighborhood.

As Bitcoin adoption increases, 
 the perceived value of Bitcoin will increase,
 which is the unit of account increasing.
The price of goods and services in Bitcoin
 send a clear signal of what people are willing
 to pay based on a truly scarce resource.

Price signals in fiat are very messy, but they
 become very clear in Bitcoin. 
Spending Bitcoin
 is difficult for Bitcoiners, as it should be
 with money that operates well.

However, there is a pesky *unit bias*.
In addition to having
 trouble understanding "billions of dollars",
 we have a similar difficulty understanding
 fractions,

!!! example "this costs 0.00000190 Bitcoin"




## Sats as the Standard

There are exactly 100 million Satoshis, *or Sats*, in a Bitcoin.
This is the smallest unit on the 
 [timechain](https://dergigi.com/2021/01/14/bitcoin-is-time/).
This is not the smallest possible unit of Bitcoin;
 one could use
 millisats or picosats. 
In fact, there is no end to the divisibility
 of Bitcoin.

That said -- if Bitcoin is true -- then Sats are the standard.

!!! example "this costs 190 Sats"


Imagine a "100-Sat Shoppe" or "99-Sat Store" where
 everything is 99 Sats.
This could start as the equivalent of a dollar store,
 or a 100-yen store in Japan.

![100-yen store](/images/100yen.jpg)

Now imagine rather than prices raising over time
 due to inflation, or lowering the quality of
 merchandise at the dollar store,
 the opposite happens under Bitcoin.

When the BTCUSD price reaches a million, then the
 100-Sat Shoppe would resemble a dollar store.
 But as the global economy grows, the 100-Sat Shoppe
 would offer higher end goods, or bulk quantities
 of lower end goods, all to justify 100 Sats;
 eventually a Sat Shoppe opens where everything is
 only 1 Sat.

And even then, as the economy
 continued to grow,
 the quality of goods at the Sat Shoppe
 would increase to justify the hefty price tag 
 of a full Satoshi.
