# Bitcoin as a Unit of Account

This is the most important quality of money.
 Don't let the benign name, *unit of account*, 
 fool you.
A unit of account is *the* measure of value,
 the measure of value that all human beings
 can agree upon such that our subjective
 and continuously changing perception of
 *value* can be rendered knowable.

An interesting practice amongst investors
 when dealing with large sums of money is
 to quantify them in other measures where
 the extremely large numbers can be
 easily intuited.

This is because it's difficult to intuitively
 understand
 a billion dollars, or hundreds of millions
 of dollars, let alone the quadrillions of
 dollars of
 unfunded liabilities tied up in derivative
 schemes.

For example, an investor may refer to
 Bentleys, or bottles of Cristal, as more
 convenient units than dollars.

> I'm not going to sweat over this 50 Cristal client when there's 5 Bentleys on the other line.

In this case Bentley and Cristal are being
 used in the abstract as units of account.

## Inflationary unit of account

Inflationary money makes for a terrible
 unit of account.

This is because you must
 "adjust for inflation", or append the date, 
 or both.

E.g., this was $100 in 2019, which is $107
 adjusted by CPI, but right now it costs
 $315 because of *actual* inflation.

## Deflationary unit of account

Due to it's fixed supply Bitcoin operates as
 a deflationary money. That is, goods and services
 will get cheaper over time as measured in
 Bitcoin.

On one hand this presents some similar
 math problems
 that we see with inflationary
 money,

E.g., this house was 12 Bitcoin in 2019,
 which is now the price of the
 entire neighborhood.

The key difference is that any amount of Bitcoin
 is an exact fraction of all the Bitcoin that
 will ever exist. 1 Bitcoin is
 1 out of 21-million, always.

It's like using real-estate as a unit of account,
 except it's fungible and the value won't go down
 because of bad schools in your neighborhood.

As Bitcoin adoption increases, 
 the perceived value of Bitcoin will increase,
 which is the unit of account increasing.
The price of goods and services in Bitcoin
 send a clear signal of what people are willing
 to pay based on a truly scarce resource.

Price signals in fiat are very messy, but they
 become very clear in Bitcoin. Spending Bitcoin
 is difficult for Bitcoiners, as it should be
 with money that operates well.

## Sats as Unit of Account

There are 100 million Satoshis *or Sats* in a Bitcoin.
 This isn't even the smallest unit, one can describe
 millisats or picosats. 
There is no end to the divisibility
 of Bitcoin.

Imagine a "100 Sat Store" or 99-Sat Store where
 everything is 99 Sats.
This may start as a dollar store, or 99 yen store
 in Japan, but rather than raise their prices
 due to inflation or lower the quality of their
 merchandise, the opposite happens under Bitcoin.

When the BTCUSD price reaches a million, then a
 100 Sat Store resembles a dollar store.
 But as the economy grows, the 100 Sat Store
 offers higher end goods, with bulk quantities
 of lower end goods needed to justify 100 Sats,
 eventually Sat Stores appear where everything is
 1 Sat and 1 Sat only. And even then, as the economy
 continues to grow,
 the quality of goods at the 1 Sat Stores
 increase to justify the hefty price tag 
 of a full Satoshi.
