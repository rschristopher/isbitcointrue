What is the ultimate fate of the USD?
The USD was originally backed by gold. Roughly $20/ounce, then $35/ounce, then pure fiat backed by the US empire's agreement with Saudi Arabia. These are, by any measure, distinct monies, but all were known as USD.
The fate of the existing post 1971 fiat USD seems obvious, as non-sustainable systems tend to.. well.. not sustain. And we're way past the point of no return. 80% of all circulating money was created in the last two years. True inflation, monetary inflation, is already in hyperinflation, despite a massive cover up and claiming it's all transient and that price inflation is unrelated to the massive monetary inflation. The willful stupidity of modern economists is startling.

What is the effect of Bitcoin on USD?
Unsure. Let's assume that the existing powers are failing, which seems to be the most likely scenario for their increasingly hysterical and incompetent behavior. Will they take the system down with them? Yes, if they could. Will Bitcoin adoption buoy the supply chains and free market remnants? Yes, it definitely could.
The existing hysterical incompetence will try to take the system down with them, demanding unlimited power with no accountability for what any reasonable analysis would conclude as crimes against humanity. But they don't, and never had, real power. They are spokespeople for the masses, voices of the delusions.
In the end, people want to eat, feed their families, be healthy, live productive lives that offer a future that is worth their present suffering, oh and of course not needlessly die in a gulag or concentration camp. Freedom is a necessity, and without it systems fail. 
This includes the current leaders. They can't but live in the world too, and act out their human desire for freedom and flourishing.  
What made civilization possible was not the systems of control, but freedom to live good lives, freedom and opportunity to build your own life, a life that is worth living. 
The idea that, "it works", is a strange lie when looking at the historical context. CCP? USSR? The best successful examples of controlled systems. They offered no innovation other than to parasitically feed from free market civilizations. An accomplishment that other controlled systems failed to replicate. Yet they repeat this lie. Why?

Why repeat the lie?
Because it promises power and the elevation of the systems of man as God. Creating ourselves a God. What we create operates within rules, natural laws.

Bitcoin fixes this when adoption increases,
 not when it's USD price increases. 
Increase adoption of Bitcoin as money.
