# Separation of Money and State

!!! info "There is no more important problem to solve in this era than the separation of money from state."

Power over money is power over human choice.
If a state has power over money
 then there is no limit to that state's power 
 over those governed.
Controlling what people can and cannot buy,
 you need not have any law enforcement;
 power over money is sufficient enforcement
 of all human behavior and action.
Even crimes of passion become quite difficult
 when one cannot buy food or water or
 transportation.

Complete power over money is 
 *total totalitarianism*.
Such power renders
 humans into something less than slaves,
 including those managing the money.
The system itself would become all powerful,
 leaving humans to be obedient
 (in action, speech, and thought) 
 to the monetary principalities that 
 emerge from our own base instincts.

Historically, such totalitarianism has proven
 non-sustainable, collapsing under its own
 tyrannical fiat.
We can either limit technology to prevent
 this power from manifesting further,
 which puts our civilization on a dead end,
 or we separate money from state.

 


## Church and State

An often overlooked consequence
 of the establishment clause of the
 first amendment of the United States 
 is that rather than liberating politics from
 the corrupting influence of churches,
 the opposite was true.

!!! info "Churches, not politics, were set free."

This may run contrary to conventional
 wisdom, to the facade of enlightenment
 thinking that we arrogantly ascribe,
 but think about it: has the
 political class become less corrupt 
 as they separated themselves from religious
 institutions?
Or have the churches lessened their
 own corruption as they separated
 from the state, and become increasingly 
 benign places of worship?
There is much to be criticized when looking
 at modern churches, such as their
 shallow banality with no more sacredness than
 than the strip-malls where they reside, 
 but the
 inquisition
 they are not.

To the degree a church has been separated from
 state, that church has been freed of the
 corrupting influence of the state.

The same, obviously, can be true of money.




## Human Nature 

One cannot separate human nature from religion
 nor from money.
There have been religions and money
 as long as there has
 been humans.
The concepts of a store of wealth, of
 scarce and beautiful artifacts,
 what we can call
 proto-money,
 have existed in every ancient culture.
Primitive forms of money are as universal as
 primitive, usually 
 animistic,
 religions.

???+ info "Fiat Money and Ancestor Worship"
    Founding fathers, kings and queens, and
    even the most secular and supposedly 
    "enlightened" money designs are ostensibly
    a form of ancestor worship.

    These animistic tokens functioned well-enough
    for primitive economies,
    but are being replaced by
    digital money, stripped of
    their religious nature. 

    And rather than
    become a source of liberation, digital
    money has become a system of control, and
    not by mythological archetypes or even the
    pretense of a functioning religious system,
    but by mundane bureaucratic policy makers
    with unchecked power,
    parasitically feeding on the
    the people (people who don't
    even know the names of these bureaucrats).

Religious beliefs, whether secular or traditional,
 provide a moral framework and a language
 with which to communicate what are
 otherwise transcendent concepts 
 (such as truth, goodness, or meaning in life sufficient
 to bear the weight of life's suffering).
We cannot escape religion, 
 just as we cannot escape money.

Without a functioning religious belief, 
 we inevitably fall into a 
 meaning crisis.
And without a functioning money,
 we inevitably fall into servitude and debt.
We cannot escape the very human need
 for money.

But what we can do, is separate money
 from the state.
That is, to set money free from the
 corrupting influence of the state.




## Money and State

What is the ultimate fate of modern fiat,
 that is,
 what is the fate of
 the petrodollar system known as USD?

???+ info "USD sound and unsound"
    The USD was
    originally backed by gold.
    It was sound money worth roughly $20/ounce.
    Later, during the
    Breton Woods era
    it was worth $35/ounce.
    This system ended in 1971,
    the petrodollar system emerged,
    and global fiat was born.

    These are, by any measure, distinct monies,
    but all were known as "USD".

The fate of the existing
 post-1971 fiat USD seems obvious,
 as fiat systems tend to 
 hyperinflate into oblivion.
At this point fiat currencies have lost
 so much value that they're best measured in the
 number of nines (99%, 99.9%, 99.99%, and so on).

Something like 
 80% of all circulating money was created
 in 2020 and 2021. 
True inflation, monetary inflation, 
 is already in hyperinflation
 despite a massive cover up and
 claiming it was transient and that
 price inflation is unrelated to the 
 massive monetary inflation.
The willful stupidity of modern economists 
 can be startling.

What is the effect of Bitcoin on USD?
Unsure. 
Let's assume that the existing powers 
 are failing,
 which seems to be the most likely scenario
 for their increasingly hysterical and 
 incompetent behavior. 
Will they take the system down with them? 
Yes, if they could. 
Will Bitcoin adoption buoy the supply chains
 and free market remnants? 
Yes, it definitely could.
The existing hysterical incompetence will
 try to take the system down with them,
 demanding unlimited power with no
 accountability for what any reasonable
 analysis would conclude as crimes
 against humanity. 
But they don't, and never had, real power. 
They are spokespeople for the masses, 
 voices of the delusions.
In the end, people want to eat, 
 feed their families, be healthy, 
 live productive lives that offer a 
 future that is worth their present suffering, 
 oh and of course not 
 die in a gulag or concentration camp. 
Freedom is a necessity, 
 and without it systems fail. 
This includes the current leaders. 
They can't but live in the world too, 
 and act out their human desire for
 freedom and flourishing.  
What made civilization possible was not
 systems of control, 
 but freedom to live good lives, 
 freedom and opportunity to build your own life,
 a life that is worth living.

The idea that,
 "it works", is a strange lie
 when looking at the historical context. 
CCP? USSR? 
The best successful examples of controlled
 systems. 
They offered no innovation other than to
 parasitically feed from free market
 civilizations. 
An accomplishment that other controlled
 systems failed to replicate. 
Yet they repeat this lie. Why?

Why repeat the lie?
Because it promises power and the elevation 
 of the systems of man as God. 
Creating ourselves a God. 
What we create operates within rules,
 natural laws.

Bitcoin fixes this when adoption increases,
 not when it's USD price increases. 
Increase adoption of Bitcoin as money. 
Store of wealth, unit of account, 
 system of exchange, ...
