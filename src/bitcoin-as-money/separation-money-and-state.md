# Separation of Money and State

Power over money is power over human choice 
 and human energy.
There are and can be no limits on the power
 of a state if that state has power over money.
Power over money is 
 *total totalitarianism*.
With power over what people can and cannot buy,
 you need not have any law enforcement, as
 the power over money is sufficient enforcement
 of human behavior and action.
Even crimes of passion become quite difficult
 when one cannot buy food or water or
 transportation.
Complete power over money renders
 people into slaves,
 including the people managing the money.
The system itself becomes the all powerful
 ruler.

 


## Church and State

An often overlooked consequence
 of the establishment clause of the
 first amendment of the United States 
 is that rather than liberating politics from
 the corrupting influence of churches,
 the opposite was true.
Churches, not politics, were set free.

This may run contrary to conventional
 wisdom, to the facade of enlightenment
 thinking that we arrogantly ascribe,
 but think about it: has the
 political class become less corrupt 
 as they separate themselves from religious
 institutions?
Or have the churches lessened their
 own corruption as they separated
 from the state, and become increasingly 
 benign places of worship?
There is much to be criticized when looking
 at modern churches, such as their
 shallow banality with no more sacredness than
 than the strip-malls where they reside, 
 but the
 inquisition
 they are not.

To the degree a church has been separated from
 state, that church has been freed of the
 corrupting influence of the state.

The same, it would seem, is true of money.




## Human Nature 

One cannot separate human nature from religion
 nor from money.
There have been religions and money
 as long as there has
 been humans.
The concepts of a store of wealth, of
 scarce and beautiful artifacts and talismans,
 what we can call
 proto-money 
 have existed in every ancient culture.
Primitive forms of money are as universal as
 animistic
 religions.

Religious beliefs, whether secular or traditional,
 provide a moral framework and a language
 with which to communicate what are
 otherwise transcendent ideas
 (truth, goodness, meaning in life sufficient
 to bear the weight of life's suffering).
We cannot escape religion, 
 just as we cannot escape money.

Without a functioning religious belief, 
 we inevitably fall into a meaning crisis.
And without a functioning money,
 we inevitably fall into servitude and debt.
We cannot escape the very human need
 for money.

But what we can do, is separate money
 from the state.
That is, to set money free from the
 corrupting influence of the state.

## USD
What is the ultimate fate of the USD?
The USD was originally backed by gold.
Roughly $20/ounce, then $35/ounce,
 then pure fiat backed by the
 US empire's agreement with Saudi Arabia. 
These are, by any measure, distinct monies,
 but all were known as USD.
The fate of the existing
 post 1971 fiat USD seems obvious,
 as non-sustainable systems tend to.. 
 well.. not sustain. 
And we're way past the point of no return. 
80% of all circulating money was created
 in the last two years. 
True inflation, monetary inflation, 
 is already in hyperinflation
 despite a massive cover up and
 claiming it's all transient and that
 price inflation is unrelated to the 
 massive monetary inflation.
The willful stupidity of modern economists 
 can be startling.

What is the effect of Bitcoin on USD?
Unsure. Let's assume that the existing powers are failing, which seems to be the most likely scenario for their increasingly hysterical and incompetent behavior. Will they take the system down with them? Yes, if they could. Will Bitcoin adoption buoy the supply chains and free market remnants? Yes, it definitely could.
The existing hysterical incompetence will try to take the system down with them, demanding unlimited power with no accountability for what any reasonable analysis would conclude as crimes against humanity. But they don't, and never had, real power. They are spokespeople for the masses, voices of the delusions.
In the end, people want to eat, feed their families, be healthy, live productive lives that offer a future that is worth their present suffering, oh and of course not needlessly die in a gulag or concentration camp. Freedom is a necessity, and without it systems fail. 
This includes the current leaders. They can't but live in the world too, and act out their human desire for freedom and flourishing.  
What made civilization possible was not the systems of control, but freedom to live good lives, freedom and opportunity to build your own life, a life that is worth living. 
The idea that, "it works", is a strange lie when looking at the historical context. CCP? USSR? The best successful examples of controlled systems. They offered no innovation other than to parasitically feed from free market civilizations. An accomplishment that other controlled systems failed to replicate. Yet they repeat this lie. Why?

Why repeat the lie?
Because it promises power and the elevation of the systems of man as God. Creating ourselves a God. What we create operates within rules, natural laws.

Bitcoin fixes this when adoption increases,
 not when it's USD price increases. 
Increase adoption of Bitcoin as money. 
Store of wealth, unit of account, 
 system of exchange, ...
