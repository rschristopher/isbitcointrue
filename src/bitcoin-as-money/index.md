# Bitcoin as Money

Money is a technology that makes known the
 ever-changing perspectives of value of every
 human being on earth.
Money stores value through time,
 and can be transmitted from anywhere
 humans wish to transact.

We will examine Bitcoin as money, that is,
 *how does Bitcoin perform as money?*

For if Bitcoin is true, it must be a superior
 money to fiat, as well as to all the systems
 of control that Bitcoin aims to replace.
It must be so superior that it's ascent is
 only a matter of when and not if, that is
 the only way Bitcoin can be considered *true*.
