# Bitcoin as Money

Money is the technology that makes known the
 ever-changing perspectives of value of every
 human being on earth.
Money stores value through time,
 and can be transported wherever
 humans wish to transact.

There has never been a global money,
 that is, a money that everyone on the
 globe agrees on as their 
 [unit of account](unit-of-account.md).
The closest was gold and silver.
 One could travel with gold, and use it
 in most places, provided it was not seized
 or stolen.
Wars were fought over gold,
 and if you managed to hold your
 gold over time, it would hold its value.
Nations rose and fell,
 civilization rose and fell,
 while gold held its value.

Today, the world operates on a quasi-global
 currency known as the USD, or more aptly,
 the *petrodollar*.
It began in 
 [1971](https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/),
 and is the most advanced monetary technology
 to have ever existed, up until Bitcoin.

For all its faults,
 the *petrodollar* is why you can freely exchange
 your USD to Canadian dollars or Euros or Yen
 or Yuan. 
Almost anywhere on earth you go,
 you can probably find an ATM that will 
 allow you to withdraw the local currency
 at an exchange rate that benefits both banks.

Despite the problems of fiat money,
 this technology was itself revolutionary,
 allowing decades of economic growth
 on a global scale.
The dirty secret was that this growth
 hid the seigniorage of central bankers
 that has inadvertantly bankrupted
 every country on earth,
 transforming stockpiles of wealth into an unsustainable
 mountain of debt that cannot be contained.

This system depends on two critical elements,

1. US military dominance
2. US relations with Saudi Arabia

In other words, if Saudi Arabia should fall,
 the USD would collapse overnight.
Similarly, if the US military was not the de-facto
 dominant power on earth, then the USD would collapse.
Likewise, if the US government was to collapse, 
 so too would the petrodollar.
This is what it means to be the *global reserve currency*.

Unlike gold and silver, the current global money
 depends entirely on the US government, the US Treasury,
 the Federal Reserve, the US military, the Saudi government,
 and the stable relationship between the US and the Saudis.

We will examine Bitcoin as money, that is,
 *how does Bitcoin perform as money?*

For if Bitcoin is true, it must be a de-facto superior
 money to the petrodollar, as well as to all the fiat systems
 of control that Bitcoin aims to replace.
It must be so superior that it's ascent is
 only a matter of when and not if, that is
 the only way Bitcoin could be considered *true*.
