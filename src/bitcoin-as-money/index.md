# Bitcoin as Money

<!--

Let's examine Bitcoin as money, that is,
 *how does Bitcoin perform as money?*

> “I don’t believe we shall ever have a good money again before we take the thing out of the hands of government, that is, we can’t take them violently out of the hands of government, all we can do is by some sly roundabout way introduce something they can’t stop.”
> 
> ~ Friedrich Hayek 

If Bitcoin is true,
 it must be the *something* government can't stop.
It must be a de-facto superior
 money to USD, as well as to all fiat money.
It must be so superior that it's ascent is
 only a matter of when and not if -- this is
 the only way Bitcoin could be considered *true*.


## Global Money Technology 

Money is the technology that makes known the
 ever-changing perspectives of value of every
 human being on earth.
Additionally, money must store value over time,
 and must be transmissible over large distances,
 anywhere that humans wish to transact.

There has never been a true global money,
 that is, a money that everyone on the
 globe agrees on as their 
 [unit of account](unit-of-account.md),
 [medium of exchange](medium-of-exchange.md),
 and as their 
 [store of value](store-of-value.md).

Such a technology has never existed,
 especially because a global money
 must be properly 
 decentralized and uncensorable. 
Importantly, whoever controls monetary technology
 would have power over everyone wishing to
 transact with that money.
A global money could only be possible if 
 no one controlled it.

As such, Bitcoin can only be true if
 *no one* can control it,
 or limit who can use it.
This means attempts to ban it must fail,
 as well as attempts to subvert or control
 its monetary policy.



## Gold and Silver

The closest to a global money was gold and silver.
 One could travel with gold, and use it
 in most places, provided it was not seized
 or stolen.

A kingdom would fall, but if their coins were in
 gold, the monetary value of that gold was
 transmittable elsewhere.
Wars were fought over gold,
 and if you managed to hold onto your
 gold over time, it would hold its value.
Nations rose and fell,
 civilization rose and fell,
 and gold held its value.

Unfortunately, gold cannot be transmitted
 quickly or cheaply over large distances.
This limitation gives rise to an inevitable
 system of credits and ledgers,
 promisory notes, leading to the system
 we have today.


## Petrodollar

Today, the world operates on a quasi-global
 currency known as the USD, or more aptly,
 the *petrodollar*.
It began in 
 [1971](https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/),
 supplanting all remnants of the gold standard,
 and is the most advanced monetary technology
 to have ever existed, up until Bitcoin.

For all its faults,
 the *petrodollar* is why you can freely exchange
 your USD to Canadian dollars or Euros or Yen
 or Yuan. 
Almost anywhere on earth you go,
 you can probably find an ATM that will 
 allow you to withdraw the local currency
 (at an exchange rate that benefits both banks).

Despite the many problems of fiat money,
 this technology was itself revolutionary,
 allowing decades of economic growth
 on a global scale.
The dirty secret was that this growth
 hid the seigniorage of central bankers
 that has inadvertantly bankrupted
 every country on earth,
 transforming stockpiles of wealth into an unsustainable
 mountain of debt that cannot be contained.

This system depends on two critical elements,

1. US military dominance
2. US relations with Saudi Arabia

In other words, if Saudi Arabia should fall,
 the USD would collapse overnight.
Similarly, if the US military was not the de-facto
 dominant power on earth, then the USD would collapse.
Likewise, if the US government was to collapse, 
 so too would the petrodollar.
This is what it means to be the *global reserve currency*.

Unlike gold and silver, the petrodollar
 depends entirely on the US government, the US Treasury,
 the Federal Reserve, the US military, the Saudi government,
 and a stable relationship between the US and the Saudis.
