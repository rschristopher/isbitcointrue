# Bitcoin as Money

<!--
Lord Jesus Christ

Let's examine Bitcoin as money, that is,
 *how does Bitcoin perform as money?*
 Is it sufficiently good as 
 to supplant fiat?

> “I don’t believe we shall ever have a good money again before we take the thing out of the hands of government, that is, we can’t take them violently out of the hands of government, all we can do is by some sly roundabout way introduce something they can’t stop.”
> 
> ~ Friedrich Hayek 

If Bitcoin is true,
 it must be Hayek's *"something"* 
 that government can't stop.
It must be a de-facto superior
 money to USD, as well as to all fiat money.
It must be so superior that it's ascent is
 only a matter of when and not if -- this is
 the only way Bitcoin could be considered *true*.



## Global Money

Money is the technology that makes known the
 ever-changing perspectives of value of every
 human being on earth.
Additionally, money must store value over time,
 and it must be transmissible over large distances,
 anywhere that humans wish to transact.

There has never been a true *global money*,
 that is, a money that everyone
 agrees on as their 
 [unit of account](unit-of-account.md),
 their
 [medium of exchange](medium-of-exchange.md),
 and as their 
 [store of value](store-of-value.md).

Such a technology has never existed,
 especially because such a global money
 must be properly 
 decentralized and uncensorable. 
Importantly, whoever controls monetary technology
 would have power over everyone wishing to
 transact with that money.
A global money could only be possible if 
 no one controlled it.

As such, Bitcoin can only be true if
 *no one* can control
 or limit who can use it.
This means attempts to ban it must fail,
 as well as attempts to subvert or control
 its monetary policy.



## Gold and Silver

The closest to a global money was gold and silver.
 One could travel with gold, and use it
 in most places, provided it was not seized
 or stolen.

A kingdom would fall, but if their coins were in
 gold, the monetary value of that gold was
 transmittable elsewhere.
Wars were fought over gold,
 and if you managed to hold onto your
 gold over time, it would hold its value.
Nations rose and fell,
 civilization rose and fell,
 and gold held its value.

Unfortunately, gold cannot be transmitted
 quickly or cheaply over large distances.
This limitation gives rise to an inevitable
 system of credits and ledgers,
 promisory notes, and fractional reserve,
 leading to the system
 we have today.




## Petrodollar

Today, the world operates on a quasi-global
 currency known as the USD, or more aptly,
 the 
 [*petrodollar*](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-hidden-costs-of-the-petrodollar).
It began in 
 [1971](https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/),
 supplanting the dying remains of the gold standard,
 and is the most advanced monetary technology
 to have ever existed, up until Bitcoin.

For all its faults,
 the 
 [*petrodollar*](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-hidden-costs-of-the-petrodollar)
 system is why you can freely exchange
 your USD to Canadian dollars or Euros or Yen
 or Yuan without worrying about gold.
Almost anywhere on earth you go,
 you can probably find an ATM that will 
 allow you to withdraw the local currency
 (at an exchange rate that benefits both banks).

Despite the many problems of fiat money,
 this technology was itself revolutionary,
 allowing decades of economic growth
 on a global scale.
The dirty secret was that this growth
 hid the seigniorage of central bankers
 that has inadvertantly bankrupted
 every country on earth,
 [strip mining its capital](https://allenfarrington.medium.com/the-capital-strip-mine-ec627e9fe40a),
 transforming stockpiles of wealth into an unsustainable
 mountain of debt that cannot be contained.

This system depends on two critical elements,

1. US military dominance
2. US relations with Saudi Arabia

In other words, if Saudi Arabia should fall,
 the USD petrodollar would collapse overnight.
Similarly, if the US military was not the de-facto
 dominant power on earth, then the USD would collapse.
Likewise, if the US government was to collapse, 
 so too would the USD petrodollar system.
This bizarre web of dependencies
 is what it means to be
 the *global reserve currency*.

Unlike gold and silver, the petrodollar
 depends entirely on the US government, the US Treasury,
 the Federal Reserve, the US military, the Saudi government,
 and a stable relationship between the US and the Saudis.




## Fiat Interregnum 

The design of Bitcoin is to solve the problem 
 of fiat money.
As such, Bitcoin must supplant the USD petrodollar
 as the global reserve currency.
Bitcoin must become the money of international
 settlement, ending the grotesque
 systems that attempt central control, which
 in practice do not control money but instead 
 parasitically feed on wealth.

Bitcoin need not be adopted by these
 parasitic bureaucrats that imagine themselves
 as in control; for they could or could not
 adopt Bitcoin and it will have
 no effect on the truth of Bitcoin.
For Bitcoin to be true, it need only to work.
International settlements must work using 
 Bitcoin. By doing so it will reveal the
 impotence of these parasitic bureaucrats
 that imagine themselves as in control.
Ironically, the bureaucrats openly supporting
 Bitcoin would obscure and delay its adoption.
Bitcoin is true because it works,
 and by working it will reveal the truth
 of this morally bankrupt class of parasites.

The fiat system produces this bureaucratic
 cruft, delusions of power that arise
 from the noise of the system, obscuring
 price signals and creating a class of 
 professional bureaucrats
 whose job it is to pretend
 to control money.
Bitcoin doesn't make them obsolete,
 it proves they have been impotent all along,
 like court astrologers.


Under the gold standard, it wasn't the king
 that gave value to the money, 
 it was the gold.
 The monetary value of the gold was 
 all that mattered.
Similarly, under a Bitcoin standard,
 Bitcoin is all that will matter,
 not it's adoption by bureaucrats.

In the long arch of history, the fiat system
 was birthed in 1971 although didn't really
 prove itself till years later,
 by the 1980s it was clearly working, 
 and it was uncontested until 2009, 
 until Bitcoin. 
And in a sly roundabout
 way, Bitcoin has risen into prominence as
 an open source money, poised to supplant
 the USD petrodollar, and with every year
 and decade of it working, it inches
 closer to becoming the money of
 international settlements,
 the base layer to back all currency.
