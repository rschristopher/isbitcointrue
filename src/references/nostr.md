## What is [Nostr](https://nostr-resources.com/)?

Nostr is a protocol that decentralizes social networking.
In other words, you can use *any* Nostr app and you'll be
 looking at the same social network.
In effect this replaces twitter, telegram, and other
 centrally controlled social networks -- allowing
 an uncensorable social network.

Technically, email and websites are based on
 similar protocols.
Imagine one company owned all websites and email --
 this is effectively what social media companies
 have attempted.
Nostr simply puts the power back in the hands
 of the user.
You decide what you want to read, not an "algorithm"
 written by moral busybodies and propagandists.

As such, a Nostr client app is like a web browser.
Regardless of which web browser you use,
 you are looking at the same websites.
Regardless of which Nostr client you use,
 you are looking at the same social network.
