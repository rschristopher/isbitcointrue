## What is Nostr?

Nostr is a protocol that decentralizes social networking.
In other words, you can use *any* Nostr client and you'll be
 looking at the same social network.
In effect this replaces twitter, telegram, and any other
 centrally controlled social network -- allowing
 an open and uncensorable social network.

Technically, email and websites are based on
 similar protocols.
Imagine if one company owned all websites and email --
 censoring your emails and prohibiting what you
 can write on your own website --
 this is effectively what social media companies
 have attempted.
Nostr simply puts the power back in the hands
 of the user.
You decide what you want to read, not an "algorithm"
 written by moral busybodies and propagandists.

As such, a Nostr client app is like a web browser.
Regardless of which web browser you use,
 you can be looking at the same website.
Regardless of which Nostr client you use,
 you can be looking at the same Nostr feed.
