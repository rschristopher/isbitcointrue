# Quantum Computing 

!!! warning "work in progress"

This is one of the more interesting
 and theoretical criticisms of
 Bitcoin -- it usually goes like
 this:

!!! quote "*advances in quantum computing will put millions of Bitcoin at risk, as early as next year, causing the price to drop to zero.*"

Such statements make
 for fun headlines
 but are not quite grounded
 in reality.
And we've been seeing such headlines 
 for over a decade without any real
 progress with quantum attacks on
 Bitcoin's
 elliptical curve cryptography.
The truth is there's very little
 threat for now, and in fact 
 quantum computing
 will most likely prove
 beneficial to Bitcoin;
 with Bitcoin providing incentives
 for quantum computing breakthroughs.

Importantly,
 people are concerned
 with *their* Bitcoin,
 not hypotheticals with
 someone else's
 Bitcoin that may
 or may not be
 vulnerable to a
 "quantum attack".
In other words,
 I want to know if *my*
 Bitcoin is safe.
The simple truth is,
 Bitcoin is already quantum resistant
 with a small handful of exceptions.

## Quantum Resistant

If you don't reuse addresses with
 known public keys, then your
 Bitcoin is quantum resistant.
This is the standard approach anyway,
 recommended for privacy reasons.
With most wallet software, and
 especially with cold storage solutions,
 you'd have to go out of your way 
 to make your Bitcoin vulnerable to
 a theoretic quantum attack
 (you'd need to disclose the public keys 
 that correspond to each address).

At present,
 the vulnerable
 coins to a quantum attack
 are those that have not
 moved since 2010;
 in particular,
 and most famously,
 the coins of
 Satoshi Nakamoto.
If *anyone* had the means
 to access these coins,
 they would have
 access to the largest
 bounty on earth.


## The Quantum Computing Bounty

A better, and more constructive,
 way to view Bitcoin's relationship
 with quantum computing is that
 Bitcoin is effectively
 offering an enormous
 reward to whoever can
 break Bitcoin's signing
 algorithm.
*The prize?*
Millions of untouched Bitcoin.
Quantum computing "experts"
 would not need to be
 begging the
 NSF
 for grant money
 in their fiat-funded universities,
 nor promoting scammy
 shitcoins,
 they
 could be funding themselves --
 they could be
 the wealthiest people 
 on earth --
 unless they're full of shit.

The bounty is real.
All you need to do is
 develop a quantum computer
 that breaks Bitcoin's
 elliptical curve algorithm.
These coins are otherwise
 considered lost.
If the price started
 to decline due to the sudden
 supply shock of millions
 of new Bitcoin coming
 into circulation --
 don't worry --
 there are millions
 of Bitcoiners
 that will anxiously
 and happily
 buy up those cheap
 sats.
Bitcoin will be fine,
 and it will have successfully
 funded advances
 in cryptography *and*
 quantum computing.
