# Quantum Computing 

!!! warning "work in progress"

This is one of the more interesting
 and theoretical criticisms of
 Bitcoin -- it usually goes like
 this:
 *advancements in 
 quantum computing
 will put millions
 of Bitcoin at risk,
 causing the price
 to drop to zero.*
Such statements make
 for fun headlines
 but are not quite grounded
 in reality.
People are concerned
 with *their* Bitcoin,
 not someone else's
 Bitcoin that may
 or may not be
 vulnerable to a
 "quantum attack".

The simple truth is,
 the most vulnerable
 coins to a quantum attack
 are those that have not
 moved since 2010;
 in particular,
 and most famously,
 the coins of
 Satoshi Nakamoto.
If *anyone* had the means
 to access these coins,
 they would have
 access to the largest
 bounty on earth.


## The Quantum Computing Bounty

A better, and more constructive,
 way to view Bitcoin's relationship
 with quantum computing is that
 Bitcoin is effectively
 offering an enormous
 bounty to whoever can
 break Bitcoin's signing
 algorithm.
*The prize?*
Millions of untouched Bitcoin.
Quantum computing "experts"
 would not need to be
 begging the
 NSF
 for grant money
 (fiat science),
 nor working on scammy
 shitcoins,
 they
 could be funding themselves --
 they could quickly become
 the wealthiest entities 
 on earth --
 unless they're full of shit and
 would be wise to write a 
 BIP
 rather than dumb
 fearmongering about
 topics they probably
 don't actually understand.

This bounty is real.
These coins are otherwise
 considered lost.
If the price started
 to decline due to the sudden
 supply shock of millions
 of new Bitcoin coming
 into circulation --
 there are millions
 of Bitcoiners
 that will anxiously
 and happily
 buy up those cheap
 sats.
Bitcoin will be fine,
 and it will have successfully
 funded advances
 in cryptography and
 in quantum computing.
