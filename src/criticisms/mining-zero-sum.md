# Mining is Zero Sum

The game theory of Bitcoin mining is quite
 different than the rest of Bitcoin.
Mining is a zero-sum adversarial game.
Miners are incentived to hurt their competition
 in order to ensure their own survival.

Unlike gold mining, Bitcoin miners are in
 constant and direct competition with each
 other, such that the fortune of one will
 come at the expense of all others.
And hurting one miner will directly benefit
 all other miners.
Such is the nature of a zero sum adversarial game.

On one hand, this is a benefit for decentralization,
 as any attempt to monopolize mining will result
 in an inevitable disintegration of any large entity..
Mining is like a continuous arbitrage opportunity,
 with profits that will inevitably diminish,
 forcing miners into survival mode, yet as
 miners fail this will tip the remaining miners
 into profitability, which will attract more
 miners, and the cycle repeats forever.
Unlike saving in Bitcoin, mining is a high time
 preference, high risk game.
