# Mining is Negative Sum

The game theory of Bitcoin is well regarded 
 as positive sum and incentivizing 
 cooperative behavior.
It is a marvel of technology and economics,
 resulting in the most sound money the
 world has ever known.
Yet this entire system sits atop an
 adversarial and zero sum competition 
 known as mining.

While mining can be better understood as
 decentralized payment processing, 
 the market dynamics and incentives are
 a cutthroat zero sum game.
Worse still, an iterative version of this game
 is negative sum.





## The bigger they are ...

Roughly every ten minutes a new block is found
 (mined) which increases the total supply.
Every 2016 blocks the network difficulty
 adjusts to ensure that the issuance
 is on schedule (one new block every ten minutes).
And every four years the issuance is halved
 (the famed "halvings").
This may seem simple in theory,
 but in practice the difficulty adjustment
 means that miners are in direct competition
 with each other, and worse, the halvings
  make this a negative sum game.

For example,
Imagine a big mining farm
 which mines ~10 blocks per day
 (out of 144 daily average).
They are profitable so they
 invest in their business,
 adding new fleets of machines
 in order to double their hashrate.
Once the new machines are online, this
 big mining farm 
 doubles their hashrate and
 mines ~20 blocks per day -- however, that
 means that the daily average went
 from 144 to 154.
This results in a difficulty adjustment
 that brings the daily average back to 144.
Despite doubling their hashrate,
 the higher difficulty means
 they're only mining ~18 blocks per day,
 and critically, all other
 miners suffered equally.

After the halving this miner finds themselves
 losing money, ~18 blocks per day is not enough
 to stay in business.
They shut the machines off.
The daily average drops from 144 blocks
 to 126.
The next difficulty adjustment will bring
 the average back to 144 
 (lowering the network difficulty).
Immediately, other miners see an increase 
 (as it's now less difficult to mine blocks).
A miner that was receiving ~20 blocks per day would
 now be mining ~23 blocks.

This change might cause the
 out-of-business mining farm to
 get back into the game.
They turn all their machines back on, and
 sure enough, ~23 blocks per day --
 until the next difficulty adjustment --
 and then their daily average 
 drops back to ~18, hurting
 everyone else in the process.

The only chance for this beleaguered mining
 farm to have any hope of survival is
 if other miners drop out first.
They take out loans, and relocate to find
 cheaper energy.
And in all their desperate moves, are they
 prepared for the next halving?
What about the next generation of mining
 machines?
Will they take out even more loans?





## The easier they fall

Unlike gold mining, Bitcoin miners are in
 constant and direct competition with each
 other, such that the fortune of one will
 come at the expense of all others.
And hurting one miner will directly benefit
 all other miners.
Miners that succeed will find
 their profits dwindle over time even as overall mining revenue grows.
Reserves will be tested and depleted as more
 and more competition enters the space.
And there will always be more.
Such is the nature of any zero sum adversarial game.

On one hand, this benefits decentralization,
 as any attempt to monopolize mining will result
 in inevitable attack and disintegration,
 and the cost
 of bureaucratic overhead will make the larger
 miners suffer most.
Mining, even if the value of Bitcoin was stable,
 is like a continuous arbitrage opportunity
 (finding cheap enough electricity to power advanced enough machines),
 with profits that inevitably diminish through competition.
This forces miners into survival mode, and as the weak
 miners fail this will tip the surviving miners
 into a moment of increased profitability,
 which will attract
 more entrepreneurs
 and the cycle repeats, forever.
Unlike saving in Bitcoin, which encourages 
 low time preference long-term thinking, 
 mining is a high time-preference, high risk game.

Is such a cutthroat adversarial
 zero sum game sustainable? 
For an individual miner, the
 answer is no.
However, as long as people are able and
 willing to try their hand at this competitive 
 game, then it will continue.
Ugly and embattled, will it be sufficient?
Time will tell.



## The tower of good intentions 

Most worrisome of all, is not the bad actors,
 but the good-intentioned and honest miners.
Honest and good-intentioned miners
 would not break consensus rules
 but for their own survival might ally
 into a monopoly and
 comply with regulatory agencies,
 ignoring blocks from other miners
 (the "bad" miners), 
 controlling the
 mempool and transaction fees.
With this level of control,
 a good intentioned
 monopoly would be the downfall of Bitcoin's
 decentralization.

To not get your transaction processed by the
 monopoly mining pool is to risk it being
 ignored and overwritten in a chain reorg.
Despite their good-intentions, the monopoly
 miner would lead to the same regulatory
 capture as we see with fiat.
Better if they had evil intent and broke
 consensus by changing the supply, for then
 it would result in a hard fork,
 and users could choose which chain to store
 their wealth.

For Bitcoin to be true, any attempt at
 monopolizing mining must fail.
The adversarial zero sum game must be sustainable
 and also sufficient to prevent 
 the centralization of mining,
 even amongst those foolish enough
 to bring their good intentions into
 the adversarial world of mining.
Ultimately, mining must remain a cutthroat
 zero sum game.
