The game theory of Bitcoin mining is quite
 unlike the game theory of saving, of
 storing wealth in Bitcoin.
Mining is a zero-sum adversarial game.
Miners are incentived to hurt their competition
 in order to ensure their own survival.

Unlike gold mining, Bitcoin miners are in
 constant and direct competition with each
 other, such that the fortune of one will
 come at the expense of all others.
And hurting one miner will directly benefit
 the others.
Miners that succeed will find
 their profits dwindle over time even as revenue grows.
There reserves will be tested and depleted as more
 and more competition enters the space.
And there will always be more.
Such is the nature of a zero sum adversarial game.

On one hand, this is a benefit for decentralization,
 as any attempt to monopolize mining will result
 in an inevitable disintegration, as the cost
 of bureaucratic overhead will make the larger
 miners feel the most pain.
Mining is like a continuous arbitrage opportunity,
 with profits that will inevitably diminish,
 forcing miners into survival mode, yet as some
 miners fail this will tip the remaining miners
 into a moment of profitability, which will attract more
 miners, and the cycle repeats, forever.
Unlike saving in Bitcoin, mining is a high time
 preference, high risk game.
