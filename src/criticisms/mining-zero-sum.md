The game theory of Bitcoin mining is quite
 contrary to the game theory of saving in Bitcoin.
Saving in Bitcoin is a positive sum game,
 increasing in value as a measure of adoption
 and of civilization itself.
Mining though is a zero-sum adversarial game.
And it is the foundation of the entire
 Bitcoin network.
Miners are incentived to hurt their competition
 in order to increase their own survival which
 is under constant threat.

## The bigger they are ...

Bitcoin mining serves two goals: issuance and
 settlement of transactions (through blocks).
Issuance is the block reward of new Bitcoin
 which follows 
 a predictable schedule
 (encoded in the protocol and
 enforced by the savers that give
 Bitcoin its monetary value).
Meanwhile every block added to the timechain provides
 a chronological order of transactions (based on
 block height).
Adding a transaction into a 
 block means final international settlement,
 and transaction fees are paid to the miners
 to make sure this happens.
This effectively makes miners decentralized
 payment processors.

This dual purpose of mining is necessary due to the fixed
 supply schedule, and in the future this will result
 in miners operating solely on fees, that is,
 no new issuance, but simply *proof-of-work* to
 ensure new blocks, new settlements on the
 timechain (final international settlements).
This will be an important test for the truth of
 Bitcoin.
That is, can Bitcoin survive and flourish
 after the last block subsidy is paid?
We'll know for sure in the year 2140.


## The easier they fall

Unlike gold mining, Bitcoin miners are in
 constant and direct competition with each
 other, such that the fortune of one will
 come at the expense of all others.
And hurting one miner will directly benefit
 the others.
Miners that succeed will find
 their profits dwindle over time even as revenue grows.
Reserves will be tested and depleted as more
 and more competition enters the space.
And there will always be more.
Such is the nature of any zero sum adversarial game.

On one hand, this benefits decentralization,
 as any attempt to monopolize mining will result
 in inevitable attack and disintegration, and the cost
 of bureaucratic overhead will make the larger
 miners feel the most pain.
Mining, even if the value of Bitcoin was stable,
 is like a continuous arbitrage opportunity
 (finding cheap enough electricity to power advanced enough miners),
 with profits that inevitably diminish through competition.
This forces miners into survival mode, and as the weak
 miners fail this will tip the surviving miners
 into a moment of increased profitability,
 which will attract
 more people to try to mine,
 and the cycle repeats, forever.
Unlike saving in Bitcoin, which enables low time-preference long-term thinking, 
 mining is a high time-preference, high risk game.

Is such a cutthroat adversarial
 zero sum game sustainable? 
For an individual miner, the
 answer most assuredly is no.
However, as long as people are able and
 willing to try their hand at this competitive 
 game, then it will continue.
Ugly and embattled, will it be sufficient?
Time will tell.

Most worrisome of all, is not the bad actors,
 but of honest actors who potentially gain
 a monopoly on mining.
Such an entity would not break consensus rules
 (being honest and good intentioned),
 but for their own survival would
 centralize mining, ignoring blocks
 from other miners, controlling the
 mempool and transaction fees.
With this level of control,
 such a good intentioned
 monopoly would be the downfall of Bitcoin's
 decentralization.
Better if they had evil intent and broke
 consensus by changing the supply, for then
 it would result in a hard fork,
 and users could choose which chain to store
 their wealth.
For Bitcoin to be true, any attempt at
 monopolizing mining must fail.
The adversarial zero sum game must be sustainable
 and sufficient to destroy centralization of mining.
