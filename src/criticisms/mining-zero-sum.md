# Mining is Zero Sum

The game theory of Bitcoin mining is quite
 unlike the game theory of saving in Bitcoin.
Saving in Bitcoin is a positive sum game,
 increasing in value as a measure of adoption
 and of civilization itself.
Mining is a zero-sum adversarial game.
Miners are incentived to hurt their competition
 in order to increase their own survival which
 is under constant threat.

Unlike gold mining, Bitcoin miners are in
 constant and direct competition with each
 other, such that the fortune of one will
 come at the expense of all others.
And hurting one miner will directly benefit
 the others.
Miners that succeed will find
 their profits dwindle over time even as revenue grows.
Reserves will be tested and depleted as more
 and more competition enters the space.
And there will always be more.
Such is the nature of a zero sum adversarial game.

On one hand, this is a benefit for decentralization,
 as any attempt to monopolize mining will result
 in inevitable disintegration, as the cost
 of bureaucratic overhead will make the larger
 miners feel the most pain.
Mining, even if the value of Bitcoin was stable,
 is like a continuous arbitrage opportunity,
 with profits that inevitably diminish.
 This forces miners into survival mode, and as the weak
 miners fail this will tip the remaining miners
 into a moment of profitability, which will attract more
 miners, bloodthirsty and ready to compete, and the cycle repeats, forever.
Unlike saving in Bitcoin, which enables low time-preference long-term thinking, 
 mining is a high time-preference, high risk game.

On the other hand, is such a cutthroat adversarial
 game sustainable? 
For any individual miner, the
 answer most assuredly is no.
However, as long as people and are able and
 willing to try their hand at this competitive 
 game, then it will continue.
Ugly and embattled, will it be sufficient?
Time will tell.


## Issuance and Ordering

Mining is the issuance of new Bitcoin following
 a predictable schedule, encoded in the protocol and
 enforced by the nodes, by the savers that give
 Bitcoin its monetary value.
Mining is also necessary for the ordering
 of blocks (of transactions).
This dual purpose is necessary due to the fixed
 supply schedule, which will eventually result
 in miners operating solely on fees, that is,
 no new issuance, but simply *proof-of-work* to
 ensure new blocks, new settlements on the
 timechain.
Eventually there will be no mining, only a
 competition for transaction fees.
This will be an important test for the truth of
 Bitcoin. That is, can Bitcoin survive and flourish
 after the last block subsidy is paid?
