Deflation from economic depression is not the same as deflation from economic growth, obviously.

Printing money during an economic depression does not solve the cause of the depression,
 it merely enriches the recipients of the money and leads to the problems of fiat money.

Deflationary price changes due to economic growth is not a bad thing
 and is in fact the norm throughout history.
