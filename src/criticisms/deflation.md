# Deflationary Spiral

A [deflationary spiral](https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/1888/economics/deflationary-spiral/)
 is simply the lowering of prices
 due to prior deflationary pressure.
In a debt-backed economy, like
 our current USD petrodollar,
 any kind of deflation is deadly
 because the cost of the debt
 increases.
Many wouldbe critics will claim
 that Bitcoin cannot succeed because
 it is deflationary by nature.

Deflation from economic depression is not the same as deflation from economic growth, obviously.

Printing money during an economic depression does not solve the cause of the depression,
 it merely enriches the recipients of the money and leads to the problems of fiat money.

Deflationary price changes due to economic growth is not a bad thing
 and is in fact the norm throughout history.
