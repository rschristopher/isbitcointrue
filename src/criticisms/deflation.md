# Deflationary Spiral

A [deflationary spiral](https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/1888/economics/deflationary-spiral/)
 is simply deflation (lowering of prices)
 due to prior deflationary pressure.
Many would-be critics will claim
 that Bitcoin cannot succeed because
 it is deflationary by nature and
 would create a deflationary spiral.

These kind of criticisms tend to
 be poorly thought out
 (and [unfounded](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/financialtimes/business/FT1054416347557.html)
  by empirical evidence),
 mostly naive rationalizations
 to justify the continued
 non-sustainable debt cycle
 of fiat-funded economics.
However, in a debt-backed economy, like
 our current USD petrodollar,
 any kind of deflation is deadly
 because the cost of debt
 increases.



## Debt-backed Money

Debt-backed money like the USD
 is essentially an "IOU"
 backed by the Federal Reserve,
 a promise that they'll
 provide value in the future
 -- yet that future never comes.
They just print more money to manage
 the ever-increasing debt.

Debt management becomes difficult
 if not impossible
 in a deflationary environment,
 which is why
 inflation is the necessary tool
 of central banks.
If your money is based on debt,
 and you can increase the supply
 at will (lowering the value of your debt)
 then all that is needed is to
 maintain inflation 
 (literally by *fiat*)
 without destroying
 confindence in the currency.

Strong money, like Bitcoin,
 is effectively the antithesis
 to debt-backed money --
 punishing debt and rewarding
 saving.
Bitcoin is effectively
 non-compatible
 with debt-backed money
 maintained by fiat.




## Great Depression

The most common example of a deflationary
 is the
 [Great Depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression),
 somehow confusing deflation
 based on economic contraction
 with deflation based on economic growth.
The displaced farmers were not
 sitting on stockpiles of gold,
 refusing to spend because
 the value of their savings
 was increasing.

Such reasoning is absurd.
The displaced farmers had no savings,
 they were starving.
Any gold they had would have been
 spent on food (leading to price
 inflation as their savings
 became liquid).

These kind of criticisms are
 generally too stupid and detached
 from reality to take seriously.
However, we can attempt
 to steel-man this issue
 and discuss the potential
 disadvantages of a 
 strong money
 (specifically of a deflationary currency).




!!! warning "work in progress"



Deflation from economic depression is not the same as deflation from economic growth, obviously.

Printing money during an economic depression does not solve the cause of the depression,
 it merely enriches the recipients of the money and leads to the problems of fiat money.

Deflationary price changes due to economic growth is not a bad thing
 and is in fact the norm throughout history.
