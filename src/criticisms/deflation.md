# Deflationary Spiral

A [deflationary spiral](https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/1888/economics/deflationary-spiral/)
 is simply deflation (lowering of prices)
 due to prior deflationary pressure.
Many would-be critics will claim
 that Bitcoin cannot succeed because
 it is deflationary by nature and
 would create a deflationary spiral.

These kind of criticisms tend to
 be poorly thought out
 (and [unfounded](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/financialtimes/business/FT1054416347557.html)
  by empirical evidence),
 mostly naive rationalizations
 to justify the continued
 non-sustainable debt cycle
 of fiat-funded economics.
However, in a debt-backed economy, like
 our current USD petrodollar,
 any kind of deflation is in-fact deadly
 due to the cost of debt
 increasing.



## Debt-backed Money

Debt-backed money like the USD
 is essentially an "IOU"
 backed by the Federal Reserve,
 a promise that they'll
 provide value in the future
 -- yet that future never comes.
They just print more money to manage
 the ever-increasing debt.

Debt management becomes difficult
 if not impossible
 in a deflationary environment,
 which is why
 inflation is the necessary tool
 of central banks managing via fiat.
If your money is based on debt,
 and you can increase the supply
 at will (lowering the value of your debt)
 then all that is needed is to
 maintain inflation 
 (literally by *fiat*)
 without destroying
 confidence in the currency.

Strong money, like Bitcoin,
 is effectively the antithesis
 to debt-backed money --
 punishing debt and rewarding
 saving.
Bitcoin is effectively
 non-compatible
 with debt-backed money
 maintained by fiat.




## Great Depression

The most common example of a deflationary spiral 
 is the
 [Great Depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression),
 somehow confusing deflation
 based on economic contraction
 with deflation based on economic growth.
The displaced farmers were not
 sitting on stockpiles of gold,
 refusing to spend because
 the value of their savings
 was increasing.

Such reasoning is absurd.
The displaced farmers had no savings,
 they were starving as
 their livelihoods were replaced
 by tractors and industrialization.
Any gold they had would have been
 spent on food (leading to price
 inflation as their savings
 became liquid).

These kind of criticisms are
 generally too stupid and detached
 from reality to take seriously.
However, we can attempt
 to steel-man this issue
 and discuss the potential
 disadvantages of a 
 strong money
 (specifically, a deflationary currency).



## Price Deflation

Deflation from economic depression
 is not the same as deflation from
 economic growth.
This should be obvious, but our current
 economic models somehow -- conveniently
 for those benefitting inflation --
 miss this point entirely.

Obviously, deflation due to economic
 contraction is bad.
Prices shrinking because no one
 has money to spend, this is bad.
However, prices dropping because of
 economic growth -- such as the price
 of consumer electronics over the last
 few decades, this is good, very good.
This is the good kind of deflation that never
 gets mentioned by fiat-funded academics
 (this is what fueled our economy
 over the last few decades).

Price deflation very clearly increases
 economic activity, and during times
 of economic growth this should be
 encouraged.
This is, in fact, exactly what a
 strong money like Bitcoin encourages.
Bitcoin is deflationary *only*
 due to economic growth.

When there is an economic contraction,
 Bitcoin behaves the opposite, prices
 will inflate as there is simply less
 goods being produced (constraining supply).
Yet what happens when there is a surplus
 of goods during an economic downturn?
This is indeed what happened during the
 Great Depression.

The farmers didn't return to their small 
 family farms after the recovery.
Their jobs and homesteads were replaced
 by tractors.
Industrialization is what displaced those
 farmers.

The "recovery" happened when those displaced
 farmers found new jobs in factories.
Pretending that money printing would
 have solved this phenomenon is foolish.
Printing money during an economic depression
 does not solve the cause of the depression,
 it merely enriches the recipients of the
 printed money and
 leads to the problems of fiat money.

However, what would have happened
 had Bitcoin existed during the
 Great Depression?
The farmers would still have been
 displaced.
Unemployment would have still been high.
A surplus of goods would still have
 occured, leading to reduced prices,
 the bad kind of deflation.

Overall, Bitcoin does not seem to help
 in these situations, and it does
 not pretend to.
What Bitcoin does is provide protection
 to your savings should overzealous
 central planners try to "fix" an economic
 contraction through debasement.
Central planners believe they can help,
 and yet
 all they do is make things worse and
 rationalize their failings into success
 narratives -- such as pretending
 world wars are good for an economy.



## The Ugly Truth

What Bitcoin can do during an economic
 contraction, is send *clear* price signals.
We may not like the signal, but printing money
 to obscure the truth is a far worse option.
Reality is not made by fiat, which is
 exactly what fiat money aims to do.

Bitcoin, during the Great Depression,
 would have revealed that the price
 of manual labor on a farm is no
 longer sufficient to sustain a family,
 nor is a small family farm sufficient to
 sustain a family.
Having known that earlier would have
 saved many families from the degradation
 of pretending otherwise,
 of pretending that reality is controlled
 by politicians.

Whether we like it or not,
 Bitcoin will reveal the true price
 of money itself, as well as the true price of
 food during a depression.
Bitcoin offers only truth, the rest --
 as always --
 is up to us.
