To any such criticism, one must ask,
 *what should the price of Bitcoin be?*
And with what unit of account?
That is, if Bitcoin should be worth more,
 then we can only ask:

> *more of what?*




## More silver?

Early on, Bitcoin was quick to challenge
 the value of silver.
In fact it has exceeded silver's market cap
 more than once.
That is, if a single Bitcoin could buy more than
 83 kilograms of silver, then the value of
 Bitcoin will be greater than silver.




## More gold?

Estimates for the total supply of gold vary wildly,
 but based on the most accepted estimates,
 if a single Bitcoin could buy more than
 321 ounces of gold, then the value of
 Bitcoin will be greater than gold.




## More real-estate?

> Buy land, they're not making it anymore

Should Bitcoin by worth more than
 the total value of all land on earth?
It's certainly possible to theorize on
 a price, a number of Satoshis per sqft,
 such that Bitcoin would be more valuable
 than all real estate.
But this isn't exactly useful nor practical.

Not all land is for sale, not in fiat nor gold
 nor Bitcoin. 
And the estimated market cap for real estate
 (over $300 trillion) 
 is higher than the combined GDP of all
 all nations on earth
 (under $100 trillion).
While we could price this at
 $14.3-million, it's difficult to think
 that there would still be a USD if Bitcoin
 became so valuable.

As is, all the money on earth (including
 Bitcoin) falls short of the estimated value of all land.
Even during the gold standard this was true.
There is not (and never was) enough gold
 to buy all the land on earth.
This is necessarily true because there has never
 been a single global unit of account
 (not even gold), a money
 that all people across all nations and
 ideologies agree on as their store of wealth.

Even more confounding, the total value of all
 derivatives is measured in quadrillions of dollars,
 significantly higher than all the land
 and all the money on earth combined.
Importantly, these kind of outlandish valuations
 are a unique phenomena
 that can only exist in fiat debt money.




## More fiat?

Total estimates of all fiat money are impossible to measure.
We're at the mercy of every central bank and
 nation state -- any one of which could inflate 
 their money supply overnight
 (as they are wont to do).
And because of this, it's impossible to
 calculate the minimum value of Bitcoin
 needed for it to exceed a given fiat currency
 (let alone all of them).

Perhaps the real question then is
 *-- if Bitcoin is true --*
 why has fiat not yet collapsed?





## Why has fiat not yet collapsed?

Every day that Bitcoin survives is another
 day of Bitcoin being de-facto true,
 that is, another day that no one has shown a single
 counterexample and proven Bitcoin as false.
And likewise, every day that fiat (USD, EUR, Yen, etc) survives
 is another day that the de-facto truth of Bitcoin 
 has not been sufficient for Bitcoin to become 
 the world reserve currency and global
 money.

In other words, the adoption of Bitcoin may
 have reached the point where it is de-facto
 true, practically unstoppable,
 least of all by the usual political
 machinations of central planners and their
 delusions of power;
 and yet, as long as there is still a will and want
 for fiat currency, someone willing to take a
 job in exchange for fiat money, 
 then fiat will persist.

Perhaps it will take centuries for all
 fiat money to collapse.
Or perhaps the EUR and USD hyperinflate tomorrow.
Should anyone think such a hyperinflation of
 USD or EUR is impossible, look at the history of
 fiat money and hyperinflation events.
While not as predictable as the tides, 
 hyperinflation of fiat is as
 inevitable as a tsunami.








## True value of Bitcoin 

If Bitcoin is true,
 its total value is the true value of money itself.
This is because Bitcoin has no utility other than 
 as money. 
Even gold has industrial uses, 
 meaning part of its value is separate 
 from its monetary premium.

> Bitcoin -- unlike gold, silver, and real-estate --
>  is pure monetary premium.

Fiat money is also a pure monetary premium,
 except its supply is theoretically infinite,
 and through the 
 [Cantillon effect](https://fee.org/articles/the-cantillon-effect-because-of-inflation-we-re-financing-the-financiers/)
 fiat has obscured if not broken price signals
 in every market.

Bitcoin *-- if it is true --* will send clear
 price signals into every market,
 allowing those markets to function properly.
And only then will we discover the true value of
 fine-art,
 real estate,
 food futures,
 derivatives,
 government bonds,
 and so on, until finally we know
 the true value of money itself.
Perhaps it will be far lower than the quadrillions
 of dollars we see in unfunded liabilities
 and derivatives.
Whatever it will be, will be, and it will be 
 a cold hard truth revealing the value of
 our civilization as it is, not as central 
 planners and politicians proclaim it to be.

> Money does not grow on trees.

Whatever the value, Bitcoin is the most ethical
 money to ever exist.
Saving in Bitcoin is a way to opt-out --
 opt-out of the fiat systems of control
 and coercion,
 opt-out of supporting endless wars,
 opt-out of central planning, and yes, even
 opt-out of the madness of modern art.

Bitcoin is money you can save without
 losing your soul.
It is not a hedge, its value can only
 increase along with civilization itself.
As such, using Bitcoin is a choice,
 a choice in favor of 
 a better future.
