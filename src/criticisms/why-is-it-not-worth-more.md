To any such criticism, one must ask,
 *what should the price of Bitcoin be?*
And with what unit of account?
That is, if Bitcoin should be worth more,
 *more of what?*

## More silver?

Early on, Bitcoin was quick to challenge
 the value of silver.
In fact it has exceeded silver's market cap
 more than once.
That is, if a Bitcoin could buy more than
 83 kilograms of silver, then the value of
 Bitcoin is greater than silver.

## More gold?

Estimates for the total supply of gold vary wildly,
 but based on the most accepted estimates,
 if a single Bitcoin could buy more than
 321 ounces of gold, then the value of
 Bitcoin will be greater than gold.

## More fiat?

Total estimates of all fiat money also vary wildly.
We're at the mercy of every central bank and
 nation state -- any one of which could inflate 
 their money supply overnight.
And because of this, it's impossible to
 calculate the value of Bitcoin
 needed for it to exceed fiat.
For if it did, the fiat would likely hyperinflates
 towards infinity, leading to a true value of zero
 (currency collapse).

Perhaps the real question then is
 *-- if Bitcoin is true --*
 why has fiat not yet collapsed?




## More real-estate?

> Buy land, they're not making it anymore

Will the total value of Bitcoin ever exceed
 the total value of all land on earth?
It's certainly possible to theorize on
 a price, a number of Satoshis per sqft,
 such that Bitcoin would be more valuable
 than real estate.
But this isn't exactly useful nor practical.

Not all land is for sale, not in fiat nor gold
 nor Bitcoin. 
And the estimated market cap for real estate
 (over $300 trillion) 
 is higher than the combined GDP of all
 all nations and people on earth
 (under $100 trillion).
That is, all the money on earth (including
 Bitcoin) falls short of the value of land.

Even more confounding, the total value of
 derivatives is measured in quadrillions,
 significantly higher than all the money
 on earth.





## True value of Bitcoin 

If Bitcoin is true,
 its total value is the true value of money itself.
That is, Bitcoin has no utility other than 
 as money. 
Even gold has industrial uses, 
 meaning part of its value is separate 
 from its monetary premium.
Bitcoin, unlike gold, silver, or real-estate,
 is pure monetary premium.

Fiat money is also a pure monetary premium,
 except its supply is theoretically infinite,
 and through the 
 Cantillon effect
 fiat has obscured if not broken price signals
 in every market.

Bitcoin *-- if it is true --* will send a clear
 price signal into every market,
 allowing those markets to function properly.
And we will discover the true value of
 fine art,
 real estate,
 food futures,
 derivatives,
 government bonds,
 and so on, until we know
 the true value of money itself.
Perhaps it will be far lower than the quadrillions
 of dollars we see in unfunded liabilities
 and derivatives.
Whatever it will be, will be, and it will be 
 a cold hard truth revealing the value of
 our civilization as it is, not as central 
 planners and politicians pretend it to be.
