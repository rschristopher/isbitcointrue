# Environmental Impact

This is perhaps the most common criticism
 of Bitcoin, alleging that Bitcoin mining
 is damaging the environment.
You'll find many "scientific"
 reports showing that
 Bitcoin's carbon footprint is larger than,
 say, the Netherlands.
Or that Bitcoin creates more "e-waste" than the
 Netherlands.

!!! question "Why is the Netherlands the benchmark for how much electricity a technology is morally allowed to consume?"

The problem with these arguments is that
 they're entirely disingenuous.
Bitcoin mining operates on electricity --
 *electricity* as in zero emissions.
And Bitcoin mining is consuming far
 less electricity than electric vehicles,
 phones, televisions, washing machines, etc.

Mining equipment does not require 
 [cobalt](https://earth.org/cobalt-mining/)
 nor any rare earth metals
 found in electric vehicles,
 smart phone batteries,
 and other consumer electronics.
As such, and unlike these other 
 technologies,
 there is no slavery in the Bitcoin
 supply chain.
And Bitcoin's "e-waste" is demonstrably benign
 conpared to smart phones, solar panels,
 and especially electric vehicles.

Seems a bit odd to focus on
 the ethics of Bitcoin mining
 while ignoring, say,
 rampant child slavery
 in Congo's cobalt mines
 (which you personally support
 when buying an iPhone or Android).

Disingenuous arguments aside,
 is there any environmental impact
 from Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining,
 and is the benefit of Bitcoin
 worth that damaging impact?
