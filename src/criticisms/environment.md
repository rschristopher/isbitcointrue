# Environmental Impact

This is perhaps the most common criticism
 of Bitcoin, alleging that Bitcoin mining
 is damaging the environment.
You'll find many "scientific"
 reports showing that
 Bitcoin's carbon footprint is larger than,
 say, the 
 Netherlands.
Or that Bitcoin creates more "e-waste" than the
 Netherlands.

!!! question "Why is the Netherlands the benchmark for how much electricity a technology is morally allowed to consume?"

The problem with these arguments is that
 they're entirely disingenuous and false.
Bitcoin mining operates on electricity --
 *electricity* -- as in zero emissions.
And Bitcoin mining is consuming far
 less electricity than electric vehicles,
 phones, televisions, washing machines, etc.

Mining equipment does not require 
 [cobalt](https://earth.org/cobalt-mining/)
 nor any rare earth metals
 found in electric vehicles,
 smart phone batteries,
 and other consumer electronics.
As such, and unlike these other 
 technologies,
 there is no slavery in the Bitcoin
 supply chain.
There is no strip mining and environmentally
 destructive practices.
And Bitcoin's "e-waste" is demonstrably benign
 conpared to smart phones, solar panels,
 and especially electric vehicles.

It all seems a bit odd to focus on
 the ethics of Bitcoin mining
 while ignoring, say,
 rampant child slavery
 in Congo's cobalt mines
 (which you personally support
 when buying an iPhone or Android),
 or the overthrow of
 Bolivia's
 government,
 or any of the disastrous
 strip mining operations
 necessary to make modern batteries.
There are real concerns with the
 environmental impact of technology
 and the morality of supply chains --
 focusing on Bitcoin is
 demonstrably wrongheaded
 and hypocritical.

Disingenuous arguments aside,
 is there *any* environmental impact
 from Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining,
 and if so, is the benefit of Bitcoin
 worth this environmental impact?



## Monetizing electricity 

Bitcoin mining directly monetizes 
 compute power.
If you have a cheap source of electricity,
 and access to affordable
 ASICs,
 then you can make money mining Bitcoin.
This simple set of incentives is unlike
 any in human history -- the business
 of Bitcoin mining is pure engineering,
 literally revenue-earning directly from
 the engineering.
All other engineering projects require indirect
 means of revenue generation, typically in
 the form of customers or clients paying you
 money.
In this case, it's direct --
 *if you create and propagate blocks,
 then you earn money*.
Bitcoin miners have no clients, no invoices,
 no accounts receivable.
They either mine blocks, or they perish.

This unique set of incentives monetizes
 any and all
 electricity sources.
For the first time in human history,
 power need not be generated to support
 human settlements, but instead,
 humans are directly monetizing power
 for its own sake.
This is why we're seeing off-grid mining,
 where the miners are finding and developing
 sources of electricity that are otherwise
 not monetizable to the existing grid.

This includes
 flared gas,
 abandoned coal,
 and
 excess hydro, wind, and solar.
As a result,
 Bitcoin mining
 can be done in ways that increase
 grid stability, as well as increasing the
 reach of the grid itself.
However, the economic game theory of Bitcoin
 is zero sum and adversarial.
Profitable electricity sources can and will
 be rendered unprofitable over time,
 potentially leading to abandoned facilities
 and ghost towns.

 
## Boom to bust (and back)

Like the small towns that would appear
 and prosper during a gold rush
 only to be abandoned later,
 Bitcoin mining will have this same
 effect at power generation facilities.
However, unlike gold mining, where gold
 can be strip mined, leaving the town
 high and dry,
 Bitcoin mining cares only about
 electricity generation.
Given cheap enough electricity,
 the miners will come.

While this sounds more stable than gold mining,
 in practice, the miners will leave as easily
 as they come.
Imagine a small town forming around a 
 hydro-electric powered 
 Bitcoin mining facility
Tens of thousands of machines, and
 hundreds of jobs
 arrive at this location.
A local economy forms, and for awhile
 things are good -- until
 there's a cheaper source of electricity
 and those same miners move.
Perhaps some miners stay, but due to the
 cost disadvantage, they go bankrupt
 in a few years.

The only way for the above town to
 survive Bitcoin mining economics
 is to offer
 cheap enough electricity.
Perhaps they expand the hydro-electric
 facilities and even sell electricity
 at a loss -- all in the hopes of
 revitalizing the local economy.
And maybe this works for a time,
 but eventually, they'll be priced out,
 because mining is zero sum.

In this process of booms and bust,
 what are the environmental impacts?
It's easy to focus on the success stories,
 and there will be many,
 but what about the failures?
Will mining not incentive reopening coal plants
 only to abandon them in far more reckless
 means than would have happened otherwise?

For every environmental success of using
 toxic coal from a previously abandoned
 coal plant, are we not simply creating that
 same problem all over again due to the fickle
 nature of Bitcoin mining economics?
The incentives are entirely on finding
 cheap enough power to mine and propagate blocks.
There are no incentives to do so responsibly,
 environmentally or otherwise.
