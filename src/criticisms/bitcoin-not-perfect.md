# Bitcoin is not Perfect 

This is one of the most common themes of critique,
 especially when a critic is engaged in debate with a Bitcoiner.
Once you see the pattern you'll see it everywhere.
The critic simply claims a percieved weakness
 is more important and relevant
 than it actually is.
Here are some of the most common examples of this strategy:

* criminals use Bitcoin
* mining uses a lot of electricity
* it's not fairly distributed
* the price is too volatile
* the fixed supply prevents emergency funding

The problem with the above arguments 
 is that none of them would disprove Bitcoin
 (even if the claims were valid -- they are not, but that's irrelavant).
This form of argument is a kind of trap,
 similar to 
 [Bulverism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulverism),
 where the critic
 simply distracts with unrelated noise,
 explaining *why* something is wrong without actually showing a critical flaw.

For example, Bitcoin can be true AND used by criminals,
 and still have a volatile fiat price,
 and be unfairly distributed,
 and so on -- the question of whether
 Bitcoin is true is irrelevant to all of those concerns.



## Bitcoin fixes -- everything?

In the spirit of steelmanning a more useful critique, 
 we can examine the inverse of this argument,
 that Bitcoin is or should be perfect.
What many would call hopium,
 naive Bitcoiners act as if
 Bitcoin is the panacea to fix all of society's ills.
And even more dangerous is to
 hold Bitcoin to an impossible standard and refuse or resist
 adoption till it becomes *perfect*.

!!! quote "Perfect is the enemy of good <sup>[\*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_is_the_enemy_of_good)</sup>"

It is important to remember that Bitcoin is not, and need not be, perfect.
Bitcoin only needs to be true,
 sufficiently true that it cannot be stopped or centralized.

This is also a problem amongst Bitcoiners.
For example, there are many fanatic Bitcoiners
 that simply do not use lightning payment
 rails out of concern for privacy;
 they do not run private lightning channels
 and learn how to secure their node --
 instead, they continue to use fiat
 payment rails 
 (with a kind of blindspot to the privacy problems with fiat)
 and they will say "more work needs to be done for lightning adoption".
And while this is true -- more work is always needed --
 we do not wait for others to do the work.
If we're capable of informed criticism, then
 we're capable of contributing to a 
 [BIP](https://river.com/learn/what-is-a-bitcoin-improvement-proposal-bip/).


## Good enough?

To push this criticism into true steelman territory,
 let's consider that there does exist a set of 
 necessary conditions for the truth of Bitcoin
 to materialize now and in the future.
If not *perfect*, 
 it must be *good enough*.
But what does that mean for Bitcoin to be *good enough*?

Bitcoin requires a sufficiently
 advanced civilization to have electricity, computers,
 and a global network.
Bitcoin will need self-interested developers,
 and self-interested users,
 and self-interested miners --
 all to preserve the value and decentralization
 of the network.
While this does exist now, there is no reason
 to believe this will persist into the future.
Adopting Bitcoin is very much an act of *faith* --
Faith that civilization can and should persist,
 that human progress will and should continue,
 and that a universal unit-of-account is beneficial to these ends.

To not believe in the above (with sufficient faith, beyond just rational self-interest)
 is to bow to a form nihilism that not even Bitcoin could survive.
In other words, Bitcoin depends on human civilization to survive and flourish.

Even with this faith in human civilization,
 there are some very difficult compromises
 that Bitcoin has faced, and will continue to face.
Most pressing is privacy and decentralization.
Bitcoin is not perfectly decentralized,
 and it is not perfectly private.
Compromises were made.


### Imperfect privacy

In order to provide full transparency and
 full auditability of its supply, Bitcoin
 is pseudonymous and not fully private
 nor anonymous.
In other words, sending and receiving Bitcoin
 is like writing under a pseudonym.
You can create as many wallets each with
 as many addresses as you like.
Bitcoin gives you the tools for privacy,
 but it guarantees nothing; you can reuse
 addresses and even disclose them to whoever
 you like.
As a result, it is not and never can be as
 private as cash.


### Imperfect decentralization

There are many centralizing aspects to Bitcoin.
Perhaps the most interesting area is
 Bitcoin mining.
Mining benefits from
 economies of scale
 and as such we do see larger and larger mining companies
 with early signs of monopolization --
 right up until they went
 bankrupt.
Because 
 [mining is zero sum](mining-zero-sum.md)
 it has so far proved impossible to monopolize.
However, there is no guarantee that there
 will never be a mining monopoly --
 and while this is not necessarily a risk to the
 fixed supply, this is a severe risk to
 transaction processing.
If you want a transaction in the timechain
 (the immutable ledger),
 you go through miners,
 and if mining was ever monopolized,
 there would be a centralized
 point of control of who could and could not
 transact on chain.
