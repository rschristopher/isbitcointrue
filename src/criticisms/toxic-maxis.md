# "Toxic" Maximalists

This is a rather silly and disingenuous
 criticism, although quite common.
It usually goes like this,

!!! quote "Bitcoin maxis are a toxic cult preventing BTC from succeeding."

This is clearly disingenuous because
 no one
 would use this line of reasoning
 for other assets.
Would you refuse to buy a house because a
 real-estate maximalist was a jerk on the Internet?
And more importantly, why would anyone care
 about the opinions of Bitcoin maximalists,
 as their opinions clearly have
 nothing to do with
 whether or not Bitcoin is true.
Either it will hold value, or it won't.

And, most importantly,
 are Bitcoin maximalists actually *toxic*?




## What is Bitcoin maximalism?

Let's first understand the terms.
A Bitcoin *maximalist* (maxi)
 is anyone who
 saves in Bitcoin, and Bitcoin only.
For those who view Bitcoin as an investment,
 a maximalist is one who refuses to diversify
 their portfolio.
They believe Bitcoin is
 the only viable monetary asset.

For those viewing Bitcoin as a gamble,
 a maximalist is *all in*.
For the doomers, Bitcoin is a lifeline,
 the only remaining hope for our civilization
 they see as failing.
For many, Bitcoin is an alternative to 
 stockpiling guns and survival gear
 (although not mutually exclusive) --
 in other words, fiat is failing,
 the plans to save it are horrible, and
 Bitcoin is our best hope for the continuation
 of civilization as we know it.





## What is toxic maximalism?

This label of "toxic" originally came from
 shitcoin influencers
 (*altcoins* to be euphemistic).
There were (and still are)
 rather harsh criticisms
 from Bitcoin maximalists 
 towards scams and other dishonest practices,
 especially as it relates to Bitcoin.
Whether it was
 FTX,
 SVB,
 BlockFi,
 or the
 Bitcoin hard forks resulting in
 BCH and
 BSV,
 there has been an ongoing chorus
 of criticism from Bitcoin maximalists.
And like any community made up of humans,
 there will always be those who are polite,
 and others who are not.
Arguably, it was the less-than-polite
 voices that earned the "toxic" label.

The problem with this framing, of course,
 is that the "toxic" maximalists have been
 proven right, 
 again,
 and again,
 and again.
Anyone listening to the "toxic" maximalists
 would have come out clean from the labyrinth
 of scammy muck that is our modern
 economy.











### Is that even toxic?

While there are of course bad actors
 in any group, especially online,
 outspoken criticism of an immoral
 financial system is clearly not toxic.
Calling out a scam is not toxic,
 except maybe to the scammer.
In almost every case where someone is
 complaining of "toxic maxis", you
 will likely find someone guilty
 of promoting scams,
 not promoting sound money,
 but looking to benefit from
 immoral financial schemes
 (seigniorage, fractional reserve, and so on).

As a general rule, avoid anyone who
 is complaining about "toxic maxis" --
 best case they're thin-skinned and immature;
 worst case it's a scammer who's upset
 they were exposed.






## Maximalism is not priced in

Bitcoin maxis may seem like religious 
 zealots, but they have proven,
 time and again, to be 
 the buyers of last resort.
They are why Bitcoin will hold its value over
 time, during bear markets and worse.
Toxic or otherwise, Bitcoin maximalism is not
 yet priced in.

Bitcoin maxis are why the price will
 never go to zero.
There will always be maximalists 
 saving their life energy in Bitcoin.
It is a reaction to both fiat and the failings
 of gold, and unless there emerges a more
 sound money, Bitcoin maximalists will
 remain.

In the worst case scenarios,
 where all the investors disperse,
 where the hype is dead,
 there will still be Bitcoin maximalists
 working and saving in Bitcoin,
 buying any Bitcoin you have to sell.
Even if it's banned, maximalists will still
 be there, in black and grey markets --
 *staying humble, stacking sats*.
Because of this, Bitcoin has a floor that 
 is far above zero,
 and the only ceiling is as a
 global unit of account,
 a measure of the entire global economy.
There are no fiat-priced highs where maximalists
 will stop buying,
 and no lows where they'll give up.

Eventually, as Bitcoin gains global adoption,
 maximalists will just seem like everyday 
 "savers" -- it is only now during the
 early adoption phase where Bitcoin is
 considered a speculative investment that
 "maximalist" is even a term.
And while maximalists can seem like 
 idealistic zealots 
 (esecially to those uninformed
 cynics who do not yet understand
 the fundamentals),
 they are what gives Bitcoin its value
 during these critical moments of early adoption.



### Maximalism is intrinsic value

The durability of any monetary asset depends
 on a sustainable demand.
This is why people are intuitively concerned
 with "intrinsic value" on any speculative
 investment.
The very existence of Bitcoin maximalists
 means that Bitcoin has *defacto*
 intrinsic value and is *already* money
 (the hardest money to ever exist), albeit
 to a small subset of the population.
Ultimately,
 this subset is the buoy that gives Bitcoin
 the needed (and growing) floor till it reaches
 mass adoption.






## The problems with maximalism

Despite the positive benefits of
 Bitcoin maximalism, there is much
 to criticize in this space,
 especially as Bitcoin emerges 
 from a secular culture in the midst
 of a meaning crisis with origins
 far older than fiat.
As we witness the failings of
 modernism and the progressive ethos --
 which has led to an absurd clown world
 of postmodern deconstructions of
 logic, math, morality, and meaning --
 it is tempting to ascribe deeper
 purpose and even *salvation* to Bitcoin,
 to deify Bitcoin as if it offers 
 personal redemption.
It is no different, and equally mistaken,
 to treat any worldly concern with sacred and
 religious reverence.
Whether it's politics,
 or a vague sense of activism,
 or Bitcoin,
 none of these will fulfill your
 very human need for purpose,
 let alone answer the fundamental
 questions of life.

 

!!! warning "Bitcoin doesn't fix everything"

Bitcoin fixes one thing -- just one.
Bitcoin fixes a problem of fiat,
 specifically the problem of seigniorage.
That's it.
Bitcoin doesn't fix anything else.

While the problems of seigniorage
 and the failings of fiat run deep --
 especially as it enables corrosive
 and morally reprehensible bureaucrats --
 the underlying problems still exist,
 and are not solved by the mere
 existence of Bitcoin.
Bitcoin won't provide a libertarian utopia.
It won't eliminate central planners.
It won't even remove fractional reserve.

All of our problems (save seigniorage)
 will still exist under a Bitcoin standard.
Arguably, many of today's problems are
 intractable and unsolvable because of
 fiat.
But even in this framing, 
 Bitcoin isn't fixing these problems,
 Bitcoin just gives us a chance to fix them --
 the rest is up to us.



!!! warning "Bitcoin is not a religion"

Let's dispense with the modern myth that
 we are not religious, that a secular
 worldview is even a sustainable possibility.
Humans are religious creatures.
We seek meaning with which to make sense
 of the world around us -- this is a religious
 impulse and it's inescapable.
A religious worldview is what you use to
 make sense of
 what is happening around you, with meaning
 sufficient to overcome the suffering of life
 -- there is no default worldview,
 and pretending otherwise is a regression
 inevitably into nihilism.

And as we slide into nihilism,
 it's tempting to
 grasp onto anything that seems good and
 attach to it as a religious worldview
 that can make sense of the world.
Bitcoin can seem to do this at first,
 as so many confusing and illogical things
 suddenly make more sense.
The degradation of fine art makes more sense.
The absurdity of central banks and politics
 makes more sense.
But this is because we're living under the
 poisonous influence of fiat.

Bitcoin may be the antidote to a
 specific problem in our civilization,
 but it can not make sense
 of life nor provide purpose.
In a healthy culture this would be obvious.
