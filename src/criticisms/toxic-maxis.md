# "Toxic" Maximalists

This is one of the silliest and most disingenuous
 criticisms out there.
It usually goes like this,
 Bitcoiners are a toxic cult preventing
 BTC from succeeding.
This is clearly disingenuous because no one
 would ever use this line of reasoning
 for any other asset.
Would you refuse to buy a house because some
 home owners are jerks?
And more importantly, why would anyone care
 about the opinions of Bitcoin maximalists,
 as that clearly has nothing to do with
 whether or not Bitcoin is true.
It'll either hold value, or it won't.
And, are they actually toxic?



## What is Maximalism?

Let's understand the terms.
A Bitcoin "maximalist" is simply someone who saves
 in Bitcoin, and Bitcoin only.
For those who view Bitcoin as an investment,
 a maximalist simply refuses to diversify
 their portfolio.
They believe Bitcoin is
 the only viable monetary asset.

For those viewing it as a gamble,
 a maximalist is "all in".
For the doomers, Bitcoin is a lifeline,
 the only remaining hope for a civilization
 they see as failing.
Bitcoin is an alternative to 
 stockpiling guns and survival gear
 (although not mutually exclusive) --
 in other words, fiat is failing,
 the plans to save it are horrible, and
 Bitcoin is the only hope for the continuation
 of civilization as we know it.



## What makes them toxic?

This label of "toxic" originally came from
 various shitcoin influencers
 (*altcoins* as they call them),
 because of the rather loud criticisms
 from Bitcoiners
 about perceived scams.
Whether it was
 FTX,
 SVB,
 BlockFi,
 or the
 Bitcoin hard forks resulting in
 BCH and
 BSV,
 there has been a growing chorus
 of criticism from Bitcoin maximalists
 that their targets felt was "toxic".
And like any community made up of humans,
 there will always be some who are polite,
 and others who are not.
Arguably, it was the less-than-polite
 voices that earned the "toxic" label.

The problem with this framing, of course,
 is that the "toxic" maximalists have been
 proven right, 
 again 
 and again,
 and again.
Anyone listening to the "toxic" maximalists
 would have come out okay from the labyrinth
 of financial scams that make up our modern
 economy.
