# "Toxic" Maximalists

This is one of the silliest and most disingenuous
 criticisms out there.
It usually goes like this,
 Bitcoiners are a toxic cult preventing
 BTC from succeeding.
This is clearly disingenuous because no one
 would ever use this line of reasoning
 for any other asset.
Would you refuse to buy a house because some
 home owners are jerks?
And more importantly, why would anyone care
 about the opinions of Bitcoin maximalists,
 as that clearly has nothing to do with
 whether or not Bitcoin is true.
It'll either hold value, or it won't.
And, are they actually toxic?

Let's understand the terms.
A Bitcoin "maximalist" is simply someone who saves
 in Bitcoin, and Bitcoin only.
For those who view Bitcoin as an investment,
 a maximalist simply refuses to diversify
 their portfolio.
They believe Bitcoin is
 the only viable monetary asset.
For those viewing it as a gamble,
 a maximalist is "all in".
For the doomers, Bitcoin is a lifeline,
 the only remaining hope for a civilization
 they see as failing.
Bitcoin is an alternative to 
 stockpiling guns and survival gear
 (although not mutually exclusive).
