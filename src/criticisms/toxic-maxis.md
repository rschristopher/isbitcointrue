# "Toxic" Maximalists

This is one of the silliest and most disingenuous
 criticisms.
It usually goes like this,

!!! quote "Bitcoiners are a toxic cult preventing BTC from succeeding."

This is clearly disingenuous because no one
 would ever use this line of reasoning
 for any other asset.
Would you refuse to buy a house because some
 home owner was a jerk on the Internet?
And more importantly, why would anyone care
 about the opinions of Bitcoin maximalists,
 as that clearly has nothing to do with
 whether or not Bitcoin is true.
Either it will hold value, or it won't.

And, most importantly,
 are Bitcoin maximalists actually toxic?




## What is Maximalism?

Let's first understand the terms.
A Bitcoin *maximalist* is simply someone who
 saves in Bitcoin, and Bitcoin only.
For those who view Bitcoin as an investment,
 a maximalist is one who refuses to diversify
 their portfolio.
They believe Bitcoin is
 the only viable monetary asset.

For those viewing it as a gamble,
 a maximalist is "all in".
For the doomers, Bitcoin is a lifeline,
 the only remaining hope for a civilization
 they see as failing.
Bitcoin is an alternative to 
 stockpiling guns and survival gear
 (although not mutually exclusive) --
 in other words, fiat is failing,
 the plans to save it are horrible, and
 Bitcoin is our best hope for the continuation
 of civilization as we know it.





## What is toxic maximalism?

This label of "toxic" originally came from
 shitcoin influencers
 (*altcoins* to be euphemistic).
There were (and still are)
 rather loud criticisms
 from Bitcoin maximalists 
 about perceived scams,
 especially as it relates to Bitcoin.
Whether it was
 FTX,
 SVB,
 BlockFi,
 or the
 Bitcoin hard forks resulting in
 BCH and
 BSV,
 there has been an ongoing chorus
 of criticism from Bitcoin maximalists.
And like any community made up of humans,
 there will always be those who are polite,
 and others who are not.
Arguably, it was the less-than-polite
 voices that earned the "toxic" label.

The problem with this framing, of course,
 is that the "toxic" maximalists have been
 proven right, 
 again,
 and again,
 and again.
Anyone listening to the "toxic" maximalists
 would have come out clean from the labyrinth
 of scammy muck that is our modern
 economy.











### Is this even toxic?

While there are of course bad actors
 in any group, especially online,
 outspoken criticism of dysfunctional and immoral
 financial systems is clearly not toxic.
Calling out a scam as a scam is toxic
 only to the scammer.
In almost every case of someone
 complaining of "toxic maxis" you
 will find
 online personalities who were guilty
 of promoting scams.

As a general rule, avoid anyone who
 is complaining about "toxic maxis" --
 best case it's a thin-skinned person;
 worst case it's a scammer who's upset
 they were caught.
