# "Toxic" Maximalists

This is a rather silly and disingenuous
 criticism, although quite common.
It usually goes like this,

!!! quote "Bitcoin maxis are a toxic cult preventing BTC from succeeding."

This is clearly disingenuous because
 no one
 would use this line of reasoning
 for other assets.
Would you refuse to buy a house because a
 real-estate maximalist was a jerk on the Internet?
And more importantly, why would anyone care
 about the opinions of Bitcoin maximalists,
 as that clearly has nothing to do with
 whether or not Bitcoin is true.
Either it will hold value, or it won't.

And, most importantly,
 are Bitcoin maximalists actually *toxic*?




## What is Bitcoin maximalism?

Let's first understand the terms.
A Bitcoin *maximalist* (maxi)
 is anyone who
 saves in Bitcoin, and Bitcoin only.
For those who view Bitcoin as an investment,
 a maximalist is one who refuses to diversify
 their portfolio.
They believe Bitcoin is
 the only viable monetary asset.

For those viewing Bitcoin as a gamble,
 a maximalist is *all in*.
For the doomers, Bitcoin is a lifeline,
 the only remaining hope for our civilization
 they see as failing.
For many, Bitcoin is an alternative to 
 stockpiling guns and survival gear
 (although not mutually exclusive) --
 in other words, fiat is failing,
 the plans to save it are horrible, and
 Bitcoin is our best hope for the continuation
 of civilization as we know it.





## What is toxic maximalism?

This label of "toxic" originally came from
 shitcoin influencers
 (*altcoins* to be euphemistic).
There were (and still are)
 rather harsh criticisms
 from Bitcoin maximalists 
 towards scams and other dishonest practices,
 especially as it relates to Bitcoin.
Whether it was
 FTX,
 SVB,
 BlockFi,
 or the
 Bitcoin hard forks resulting in
 BCH and
 BSV,
 there has been an ongoing chorus
 of criticism from Bitcoin maximalists.
And like any community made up of humans,
 there will always be those who are polite,
 and others who are not.
Arguably, it was the less-than-polite
 voices that earned the "toxic" label.

The problem with this framing, of course,
 is that the "toxic" maximalists have been
 proven right, 
 again,
 and again,
 and again.
Anyone listening to the "toxic" maximalists
 would have come out clean from the labyrinth
 of scammy muck that is our modern
 economy.











### Is that even toxic?

While there are of course bad actors
 in any group, especially online,
 outspoken criticism of an immoral
 financial system is clearly not toxic.
Calling out a scam is not toxic,
 except maybe to the scammer.
In almost every case where someone is
 complaining of "toxic maxis", you
 will likely find someone guilty
 of promoting scams,
 not promoting sound money,
 but looking to benefit from
 immoral financial schemes
 (seigniorage, fractional reserve, and so on).

As a general rule, avoid anyone who
 is complaining about "toxic maxis" --
 best case they're thin-skinned and immature;
 worst case it's a scammer who's upset
 they were exposed.






## Maximalism is not priced in

Toxic or otherwise, Bitcoin maximalism is not
 priced in.
Cult-like zealots have proven,
 time and time again, to be 
 the buyers of last resort.
They are why Bitcoin will hold its value over
 time, even during brutal crackdowns and
 bear markets.

This is why the price cannot ever go to zero.
There will always be a group of people
 saving their life energy in Bitcoin.
It is a reaction to fiat and the failings
 of gold, and unless there's a return to
 sound money, Bitcoin maximalists will
 remain.

In the worst case scenarios,
 where all the investors disperse,
 where the hype is dead,
 there will still be Bitcoin maximalists
 working and saving in Bitcoin,
 buying any Bitcoin you have to sell them.
Even where it's banned, maximalists will still
 be there, in black and grey markets.
Because of this, Bitcoin has a floor that 
 is far above zero,
 and the only ceiling is as a
 global unit of account.
There are no highs where maximalists
 stop buying, and no lows where they'll give up.

Eventually, as Bitcoin gains wide adoption,
 then maximalists are just simply
 "savers" -- it is only now during this
 early adoption phase that Bitcoin is
 considered a speculative investment
 by retail and institutional investors.
And maximalists can seem like 
 idealistic zealots to those uninformed
 cynics who are still trying to understand
 the fundamentals.
The durability of any monetary asset depends
 on a sustainable demand.
This is why people are intuitively concerned
 with "implicit value" on any speculative
 investment.
The very existence of Bitcoin maximalists
 means that Bitcoin is already a money, albeit
 to a small subset of the population.
This subset is the buoy that gives Bitcoin
 the needed floor till it reaches mass adoption
 and is viewed globally as "money".
