# Surveillance

This is not a common criticism.
it goes unnoticed in mainstream media,
 and perhaps unsurprisingly it remains the
 biggest risk to the truth of Bitcoin.
For Bitcoin to be true, it must be sufficiently
 unstoppable and decentralized, allowing anyone
 -- even those we dislike, even those we loathe --
 to use Bitcoin without fear of
 financial censorship.
Unfortunately, because Bitcoin is fully
 auditable on the base layer
 -- which is necessary to verify the fixed supply --
 it is not perfectly private nor free
 from potential censorship.

Any digital currency will have this problem.
By virtue of being *digital* it will be
 as easy to surveil as the network itself.
Unlike physical tokens such as coins,
 a digital money will be traceable.

While there are coin-mixing services which can
 obfuscate the tracing of Bitcoin,
 ultimately it's possible to know
 where specific Bitcoin was once spent and
 the path it took to get into your possession.
It's all pseudonymous but the trace is still there.
This could lead to the idea of *tainted* Bitcoin
 (that is, your Bitcoin may or may not have once
 touched illicit activity).
Moreover, it would even be possible to whitelist
 transactions and only allow *approved*
 Bitcoin into a given market.

For example, let's say the Bitcoin in your
 possession was once used to finance terrorism
 (according to some unaccountable bureaucrat),
 and yet you had earned it honestly by
 selling goods and services.
Imagine those funds are seized,
 because law enforcement held you liable for
 being in possession of this Bitcoin.
After such an event, or even knowing
 such authoritarian overreach is possible,
 you would likely comply with whitelists
 in all future transactions, meaning you as
 a business are faced with the impossible task
 of vetting all your customers and scrutinizing
 their payments, all to ensure the
 risk of seizure from the authorities is
 minimized.

Whether we like it or not, we live in such
 a system right now.
But what -- *if anything* -- can be done?
And at what level of censorship would
 Bitcoin be rendered false?
In both cases, the answer lies in the impossible
 task of whitelisting money.


## The Impossibility of Whitelisting Money

Money exists in order to solve
 problems; such as
 [storing value](../bitcoin-as-money/store-of-value.md)
 over time.
More simply, money solves for uncertainty.
We all attempt to store value over time
 to reduce the
 uncertainties of the future.
Even in the simplest of circumstances,
 prices may increase on items important to us;
 and we store wealth to survive those kind
 of supply shocks.

Before modern economies we learned to
 store food, drying meat and raising 
 livestock in order to manage uncertainty
 (avoiding famine).
As societies grew and evolved, the need
 for a medium of exchange grew.
And as history proves,
 good money enabled societies to scale,
 so not everyone needs to be
 drying meats and raising 
 livestock in order to avoid a famine.
Good money allowed specialization, artisans
 and engineers and even the dreaded
 central planners.

But money is good only
 to the degree there is trust in the money itself;
 trust that the money will hold its value over
 time, so rather than raise livestock one
 can choose to hold money, knowing that 
 someone else will get rich raising livestock.
The holder of the money creates a demand,
 and markets are formed, more complex
 societies emerge with more and more efficiency.
The ascent of man is exactly this story,
 humans flourishing with ever-increasing
 efficiency and scale.

But what if the money is not trusted?
What if a central authority can decide
 your money is no good?
In this situation you're back to raising
 your own livestock.
This isn't a minor setback,
 this puts us back to the earliest
 stage of civilization, where
 only small agrarian communities
 could exist.
There's a reason centrally planned
 markets lead to starvation.

Whether Bitcoin can survive or not rests
 on this very basic question:
Can markets function freely
 in the information age
 (where mass surveillance is the norm)?
Or will the temptation for
 surveillance and control
 be too great?
The outcome will decide the
 fate of our civilization,
 Bitcoin standard or otherwise.

Ultimately, the very nature of money
 precludes whitelisting and gatekeeping.
Economic activities must remain
 sufficiently free.
And while there will always
 be a need for legal trusts, that is,
 legal arrangements where an entity
 empowers their financial decisions
 to someone else, the *trustee*,
 society cannot function
 if everyone is a trustor to
 a centrally planned trustee.
These centrally planned societies
 fail
 quite
 spectacularly.


## Can Bitcoin fix this?

No -- *and let's not mince words* --
 this is a problem that
 Bitcoin does not fix.
Bitcoin can be part of the 
 solution -- but we must do
 the work.
Bitcoin is but a tool to our
 advantage in fixing this problem.

Think of this as a 
 great filter
 and that Bitcoin is but
 one of many necessary
 conditions for humanity
 to advance.
Money is either free, or not.
Markets can be free, or not.
And if not, then we starve
 our civilization back into
 agrarian self-sufficiency
 (this is the historic pattern afterall).
Perhaps another gold standard
 would emerge and humanity
 would get yet another chance.

But whether or not we make it
 as a civilization depends
 entirely on this very 
 basic existential problem.
Do we assume responsibility
 and allow
 for a suffienctly free market
 to produce and maintain
 a good digital money?
In other words, a money that
 can survive and flourish in the
 information age in spite of mass
 surveillance?

Bitcoin privacy tools exist,
 using Bitcoin in ways to counter
 surveillance exists, but
 will they be widely adopted
 enough for Bitcoin to succeed
 in the face of authoritarian
 overreach?

Only time will tell, and our decisions
 -- *you and me* -- will determine the outcome.
