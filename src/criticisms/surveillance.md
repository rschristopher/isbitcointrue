# Surveillance

This is one of the least common criticisms,
 and perhaps unsurprisingly it remains the
 biggest risk to the truth of Bitcoin.
For Bitcoin to be true, it must be sufficiently
 unstoppable and decentralized, allowing anyone
 -- even those we dislike, even those we loathe --
 to use Bitcoin without fear of
 financial censorship.
Unfortunately, because Bitcoin is fully
 auditable on the base layer
 -- which is necessary to verify the fixed supply --
 it is not perfectly private nor free
 from potential censorship.

Any digital currency will have this problem.
Unlike physical tokens such as coins,
 a digital money will be traceable.
There are mixing services which can
 obfuscate the tracing of Bitcoin, but
 ultimately it's possible to know
 where specific sats were once spent and
 the path they took to get into your possession.
This could lead to the idea of *tainted Bitcoin*
 that becomes difficult to spend.
Moreover, it would even be possible to whitelist
 transactions and only allow *approved*
 Bitcoin into a given market.

For example, let's say the Bitcoin in your
 possession was once used to finance terrorism,
 and yet you had earned it honestly by
 selling goods and services.
Imagine the funds are seized,
 because law enforcement held you liable for
 being in possession of this Bitcoin.
After such an event, or even knowing
 such authoritarian overreach is possible,
 you would likely comply with whitelists
 in all future transactions, meaning you as
 a business are faced with the impossible task
 of vetting all your customers and scrutinizing
 their payments, all to ensure the
 risk of seizure from the authorities is
 minimized.

Whether we like it or not, we live in such
 a system right now.
But what -- if anything -- can be done?
And at what level of censorship would
 Bitcoin be rendered false?
In both cases, the answer is in the impossible
 task of whitelisting money.


## The Impossibility of Whitelisting Money

Money exists in order to solve
 problems; such as
 [storing value](../bitcoin-as-money/store-of-value.md)
 over time.
More simply, money solves for uncertainty.
We all attempt to store value over time
 to reduce the
 uncertainties of the future.

Prices may increase on items important to us;
 we store wealth to survive those kind
 of supply shocks.
Even before modern economies we learned to
 store food, drying meat and raising 
 *livestock* in order to manage uncertainty.
And good money allows societies to scale,
 so not everyone is drying meats and raising 
 livestock.
Good money allows specialization, but only
 to the degree there is trust in the money itself.

Good money can be trusted to hold its value over
 time, so rather than raise livestock one
 can choose to hold money, knowing that 
 someone else is getting rich raising livestock.
But what if the money is not trusted?
What if a central authority can decide
 your money is no good?
In this situation you're back to raising
 your own livestock.
