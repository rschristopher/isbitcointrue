# Cantillon Bubbles

This is a very misunderstood
 problem --
 specifically, Bitcoin's
 price inflation problem.
In practice, Bitcoin is deflationary money,
 such that under a Bitcoin standard
 prices should decrease over time,
 leading to more purchasing power
 for savers.
However, this assumes the market
 of circulating coins remains
 constant in every market,
 but in practice there
 is likely to be
 [supply shocks](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/supplyshock.asp)
 and what can be called
 *Cantillon bubbles*.


## What is a Cantillon Bubble?

The
 [Cantillon Effect](https://fee.org/articles/the-cantillon-effect-because-of-inflation-we-re-financing-the-financiers/)
 typically refers to fiat money
 and seigniorage granted
 to insiders.
The Cantillon effect can not exist
 under a Bitcoin standard.
However, while this is true in
 absolute terms over the entire
 Bitcoin network,
 local markets can and will
 suffer supply shocks,
 price inflation, and
 cornered markets.

!!! quote "the markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent."

The deleterious effects of Keynesian
 economics are not only possible
 under a Bitcoin standard but
 also very likely.
And while such effects
 cannot sustain indefinitely,
 the threat and the risk is
 still there.
Even worse, every attempt at such
 market manipulations
 will likely correspond
 with attempts at fractional
 reserve and seigniorage.

Ultimately, this is an ethical
 problem.
Bitcoin
 provides an asymetric advantage
 to savers, but there will always
 remain a threat from
 self-interested parasites
 looking to gain the value
 of others' honest labor.
This is the definition of criminality,
 and is a problem that Bitcoin
 does not fully "fix", but rather
 can only make such criminality
 more costly 
 (but certainly not impossible).




### How does it work?


Imagine an efficient local economy with
 a small circulating supply -- 
 let's say 1 Bitcoin average.
Prices are in sats and traded over
 lightning with very few on-chain
 transactions
 (just periodic settlements).
Wages are paid, food and fuel is
 purchased with regular predictability.

Then, one day, an outsider brings
 in 50,000 Bitcoin into this market.
They could buy every business and
 control the entire supply chain.
The influx of new Bitcoin can inflate
 prices in this local market,
 leading to a mini-bubble,
 all based on the whims of this
 new -- and very wealthy --
 entity.

An efficient market hypothesis
 will predict that prices will
 stabilize over time as the 
 new Bitcoin finds its way
 into the strongest hands.
However, unlike gold, Bitcoin
 can be transferred anywhere
 on earth with relative ease.
The now wealthy local economy
 may even attract foreign
 investors -- further
 exacerbating the price inflation.

Every local market would be vulnerable
 to thexe Cantillon bubbles,
 and worse,
 those most susceptible to 
 "paper Bitcoin"
 (fractional reserve schemes)
 would likely be targetted 
 by investors looking
 to extract wealth.
