# Cantillon Bubbles

This is a very misunderstood
 problem --
 specifically, Bitcoin's
 price inflation problem.
In practice, Bitcoin is deflationary money,
 such that under a Bitcoin standard
 prices should decrease over time,
 leading to more purchasing power
 for savers.

However, this assumes the market
 of circulating coins remains
 constant in every market,
 but in practice there
 is likely to be
 [supply shocks](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/supplyshock.asp)
 and what can be called
 *Cantillon bubbles*.


## What is a Cantillon Bubble?

The
 [Cantillon Effect](https://fee.org/articles/the-cantillon-effect-because-of-inflation-we-re-financing-the-financiers/)
 typically refers to fiat money
 and seigniorage granted
 to insiders.
The Cantillon effect can not exist
 under a Bitcoin standard.
However, while this is true in
 absolute terms over the entire
 Bitcoin network,
 local markets can and will
 suffer supply shocks,
 price inflation, and
 cornered markets.

!!! quote "the markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent."

The deleterious effects of Keynesian
 economics are not only possible
 under a Bitcoin standard but
 also very likely.
And while such effects
 cannot sustain indefinitely,
 the threat and the risk is
 still there.
Even worse, every attempt at such
 market manipulations
 will likely correspond
 with attempts at fractional
 reserve and seigniorage.

Ultimately, this is an ethical
 problem.
Bitcoin
 provides an asymetric advantage
 to savers, but there will always
 remain a threat from
 self-interested parasites
 looking to gain the value
 of others' honest labor.
This is the definition of criminality,
 and is a problem that Bitcoin
 does not fully "fix", but rather
 can only make such criminality
 more costly 
 (but certainly not impossible).




### How does it work?

Imagine an efficient local economy with
 a small circulating supply -- 
 let's say 1 Bitcoin on average
 with 10-20 Bitcoin in people's savings.
Prices are in sats and traded over
 lightning with very few on-chain
 transactions
 (just periodic settlements).
Wages are paid, food and fuel is
 purchased with regular predictability.

Then, one day, an outsider brings
 in 50,000 Bitcoin into this market.
They could buy every business and
 control the entire supply chain.
The influx of new Bitcoin would inflate
 prices in this local market,
 leading to a mini-bubble,
 all based on the whims of this
 very wealthy
 entity.

An efficient market hypothesis
 will predict that prices will
 stabilize over time as the 
 new Bitcoin finds its way
 into the strongest hands.
However, unlike gold, Bitcoin
 can be transferred anywhere
 on earth with relative ease.
The inflated local economy
 may even attract foreign
 investors -- further
 exacerbating the price inflation.

Every local market would be vulnerable
 to these Cantillon bubbles,
 and worse,
 those most susceptible to 
 "paper Bitcoin"
 (fractional reserve schemes)
 would likely be targetted 
 by investors looking
 to extract wealth.
An unscrupulous financier 
 would push for fractional
 reserve schemes in any these
 local economies.
Many honest people will
 likely fall victim to
 various "paper Bitcoin" scams.

In practice, as long as there's
 someone willing to take the bait,
 this problem will persist.
Localized supply shocks and price
 inflation will happen with
 exactly the same problems we see
 with fiat.
The notable difference is that
 the scammers under a Bitcoin standard
 will need to be more competent
 to pull off their grift than
 modern central bankers.



## What can be done?

Technically, nothing about Bitcoin
 will prevent this -- and because of the
 decentralized nature it will be impossible
 to adequately regulate.
What can be done, and this may likely
 prove itself out over time,
 is stringent laws against
 fractional reserve and
 a wiser civilization where
 all individuals know that
 they must save in Bitcoin 
 (at the base layer).
There are no guarantees, and
 it may take several generations
 for any culture or local
 civilization to advance itself
 beyond fractional reserve.

Ultimately, Bitcoin presents
 all of humanity,
 the entirety of global civilization,
 with a game that's ours to lose.
