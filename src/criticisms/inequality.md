# Inequality

!!! quote "Under a Bitcoin Standard, wealth will be too concentrated."

While there is a lot of bad faith criticisms
 about inequality and Bitcoin,
 this is an area that deserves
 nuanced exploration.
Inequality presents a moral claim,
 and it might be helpful
 to suss out the moral claims
 from the technical claims
 and understand them as such.
It is not useful to employ moral arguments
 when pursuing truth
 -- *if Bitcoin is true*,
 it's not because it's good or bad,
 it's because it's true.

In other words, if Bitcoin
 turned out to be morally reprehensible,
 resulting in a catastrophic end for civilization,
 would that make it false?
No, it would still (obviously) be true.
Importantly, knowledge of such immorality 
 would do nothing to stop it, much like
 knowledge of the problems of fiat don't fix
 the problems of fiat.

However, knowledge of the morality
 of Bitcoin can help guide us as
 individuals seeking truth in order to 
 live moral lives, and aim towards
 a good future.




## Technical Claims

!!! quote "Bitcoin may lead to more inequality"

Compared to what?
Definitely not fiat.
The fixed supply of Bitcoin prevents
 [Cantillon](https://www.swfinstitute.org/news/89070/what-is-the-cantillon-effect-and-why-its-even-more-important-now)
 insiders from enriching themselves
 through seigniorage.
Fiat is unconstrained and the supply is
 controlled by the dictates of those in power.

Since [1971](https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/),
 since the start of global fiat,
 inequality has only gone up.
We are now at a level of inequality
 never before seen in the US,
 greater inequality than
 even the famed "guilded age".
Whatever may be true of Bitcoin's
 inequality, this claim that
 Bitcoin could lead to more inequality
 than fiat is demonstrably false.


!!! quote "Bitcoin won't fix existing inequality"

How could it not?
You can no longer arbitrarily inflate
 the money supply and concentrate wealth.
The only way to acquire 
 Bitcoin is through work,
 producing
 something others find valuable
 -or-
 confiscating wealth from others
 (through taxation or by other means);
 either way, this requires work.

Under Bitcoin, 
 wealth isn't
 subsidized through government grants
 or easy money policies.
However, we should consider that our
 entire culture and modern society
 has grown from fiat and seigniorage.
What are the ramifications
 of sound money on a population that
 grew accustom to fiat?

It's clear that Bitcoin won't
 continue the existing inequality;
 but it's not clear that it reduces
 the level of
 inequality.
It's possible that a Bitcoin standard
 will simply lead to
 a similar level of inequality
 but with wealth concentrated in different
 places than politicians and central bankers.
Perhaps all that it does is replace one
 group of oligarchs with another.

The claim that Bitcoin won't fix
 existing fiat inequality
 is most likely false,
 but not definitively so --
 only time will tell exactly
 what inequality
 may look like 
 under a Bitcoin standard.









## Moral Claims

The technical claims about Bitcoin and inequality
 range from definitely false to most likely false.
It's difficult to find a reasonable scenario
 where inequality is as bad as it is under fiat.
However, we can steel-man this argument and
 explore the kind of dangers inequality would
 pose under a Bitcoin standard and what,
 if anything,
 could be done about it.


!!! quote "inequality is bad."

Is it even possible not to have inequality? What would that even mean?

We live in a universe of unequal distributions, specifically
 [Pareto distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution)



In which case fiat is morally evil and should be condemned as such.
