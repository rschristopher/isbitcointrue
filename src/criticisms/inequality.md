# Inequality and Bitcoin

> Under a Bitcoin Standard, won't the rich continue to get richer?

While there is a lot of bad faith criticisms
 about inequality and Bitcoin,
 this is an area that deserves
 nuanced exploration.
There is an unquestioned
 moral claim behind inequality
 arguments, and it is helpful
 to suss out the moral claims
 and understand them as such
 (rather than as technical claims).

In other words, Bitcoin may
 turn out to be morally reprehensible,
 leading to catastrophic ends for civilization,
 but that doesn't mean it isn't true.
And knowledge of its immorality 
 may do nothing to stop it, much like
 knowledge of the problems of fiat don't fix
 the problems of fiat.


Moral Assumptions

Inequality beyond a natural distribution is bad.

We should not support bad systems.
