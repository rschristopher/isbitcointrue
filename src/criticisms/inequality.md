# Inequality and Bitcoin

> Under a Bitcoin Standard, won't the rich continue to get richer?

While there is a lot of bad faith criticisms
 about inequality and Bitcoin,
 this is an area that deserves
 nuanced exploration.
There are 
 moral claims behind inequality
 arguments, and it might be helpful
 to suss out the moral claims
 and understand them as such
 (rather than as technical claims).

In other words, what if Bitcoin
 turned out to be morally reprehensible,
 resulting in a catastrophic end for civilization?
Would that make it false?
No, no it wouldn't.
Importantly, knowledge of such immorality 
 would do nothing to stop it, much like
 knowledge of the problems of fiat don't fix
 the problems of fiat.

But let's first address the technical claims.


## Technical Claims


### Bitcoin may lead to more inequality

Compared to what?

Definitely not fiat.

The fixed supply of Bitcoin prevents this.
Fiat is unconstrained and the supply is
 controlled by the dictates of those in power.

Since 1971, since the start of global fiat,
 inequality has only gone up.
We are now at a level of inequality
 never before seen in the US,
 greater inequality than
 even the famed "guilded age".


### Bitcoin won't fix existing inequality

How could it not?

You can no longer arbitrarily inflate
 the money supply. The only way to earn
 money is through work, producing
 something others find valuable.

Under Bitcoin, no one could accumulate
 wealth without producing that equivalent
 amount of value.
In other words, wealth isn't
 subsidized through government grants
 or easy money policies.


What are the ramifications
 of sound money on a population that
 grew accustom to fiat?









Moral Assumptions

Inequality beyond a natural distribution is bad.

We should not support bad systems.
