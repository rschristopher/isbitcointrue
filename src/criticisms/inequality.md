# Inequality

While there is a lot of bad faith criticisms
 about inequality and Bitcoin,
 this is an area that deserves
 nuanced exploration.
Inequality presents a moral claim,
 and it might be helpful
 to suss out the moral claims
 from the technical claims
 and understand them as such.
It is not useful to employ moral arguments
 when pursuing technical truth
 -- *if Bitcoin is true*,
 it's not because it's good or bad,
 it's because it's true.

In other words, if Bitcoin
 turned out to be morally reprehensible,
 resulting in a catastrophic end for civilization,
 would that make it false?
No, it would still (obviously) be true.
Importantly, knowledge of such immorality 
 would do nothing to stop it, much like
 knowledge of the problems of fiat don't fix the problems of fiat.

However, knowledge of the morality
 of Bitcoin can help guide us as
 individuals seeking truth in order to 
 live moral lives, and aim towards
 a good future.




## Technical Claims

!!! quote "Bitcoin may lead to more inequality"

Compared to what?
Definitely not fiat.
The fixed supply of Bitcoin prevents
 [Cantillon](https://www.swfinstitute.org/news/89070/what-is-the-cantillon-effect-and-why-its-even-more-important-now)
 insiders from enriching themselves
 through seigniorage.
Fiat is unconstrained and the supply is
 controlled by the dictates of those in power.

Since [1971](https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/),
 since the start of global fiat,
 inequality has only increased.
We are now at a level of inequality
 never before seen in the world,
 greater inequality than
 even the famed "guilded age".
Whatever may be true of Bitcoin's
 inequality, this claim that
 Bitcoin could lead to more inequality
 than fiat is demonstrably false.


!!! quote "Bitcoin won't fix existing inequality"

How could it not?
You can no longer arbitrarily inflate
 the money supply and concentrate wealth.
The only way to acquire 
 Bitcoin is through work,
 producing
 something others find valuable
 -or-
 confiscating wealth from others
 (through taxation or by other means);
 either way, this requires work.

Under Bitcoin, 
 wealth isn't
 subsidized through government grants
 or easy money policies.
However, we should consider that our
 entire culture and modern society
 has been corrupted by fiat and seigniorage.
What are the ramifications
 of sound money on a population that
 grew accustom to fiat?

It's clear that Bitcoin won't (and can't)
 continue growing the existing inequality;
 but it's not clear that it reduces
 the level of
 inequality.
It's possible that a Bitcoin standard
 will simply lead to
 a similar level of inequality
 but with wealth concentrated in different
 places than politicians and central bankers.
Perhaps all that it does is replace one
 group of oligarchs with another.

The claim that Bitcoin won't fix
 existing fiat inequality
 is most likely false,
 but not definitively so --
 only time will tell exactly
 what inequality
 will look like 
 under a Bitcoin standard.









## Moral Claims

The technical claims about Bitcoin's inequality
 range from definitely false to most likely false.
It's difficult to find a reasonable scenario
 where inequality under a Bitcoin standard
 continues as it is under fiat.
However, we can steel-man this argument and
 explore the moral issues inequality would
 pose under a Bitcoin standard and what,
 if anything,
 could be done about it.


!!! quote "Inequality is bad"

Is it even possible not to have inequality?
Perfect equality, what would that even mean?
We live in a universe of unequal distributions, specifically
 [Pareto distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution).
There is a natural distribution one can expect,
 and to fight against this seems as wise as
 fighting against mathematics.

However, it is also clear that there
 exists within our fiat system
 extreme and (dare we say)
 unnatural levels of inequality.
In other words,
 wealth inequality beyond a Pareto distribution.
In practice, when inequality breaks
 the social order, stratifying a single
 society into multiple societies, this
 is clearly beyond a "natural distribution".
Further, the destructive influence of this
 kind of cultural disintegration can most
 certainly be considered morally wrong
 (assuming the culture in question is
 better than its disintegrated parts).


!!! quote "Inequality beyond a natural distribution is bad"

This claim is difficult to argue against.
Obviously if income inequality grew beyond a
 natural distribution such that our civilization
 disintegrates -- this would be very bad.
In fact, this is exactly what we're witnessing
 today in this ~50 year global fiat experiment.
The wealth gap is accelerating such that the
 top 0.01% are making the rest of the top 1%
 feel like the bottom 99%.
But worse, there are insufficient cultural
 touchstones to unite society.

In the interest of steelmanning this argument,
 let's imagine that a Bitcoin standard
 does nothing to fix this problem;
 that the same extreme inequality we see
 with fiat persists with Bitcoin.
In this situation, Bitcoin will fail.
Let's be clear, this would disprove
 Bitcoin, rendering it false.
A stratified civilization cannot
 and will not sustain the level of
 infrastructure and cooperation needed
 for Bitcoin.
Remember, Bitcoin requires electricity,
 computers, and a global network.

> *"And if a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand."*

Fortunately, the technical claim here is
 most likely false.
In fact, if inequality under a Bitcoin standard 
 returns to a more natural distribution,
 then Bitcoin will have "fixed" this issue.
Otherwise, and importantly for the survival
 of our civilization, this issue must be
 resolved;
 if not by Bitcoin than something else.

*This would mean Bitcoin is
 "necessary but not sufficient"
 for the survival and flourishing
 of human civilization.*

For many other reasons, this is perhaps
 the most healthy view to take.
Bitcoin does and can solve many important
 problems, but it cannot succeed
 without us choosing the right
 path, the moral path --
 that which is best for you and your family,
 now and in the future, and simultaneously
 what is best for those around you in your
 community and in the broader culture,
 now and in the future.
