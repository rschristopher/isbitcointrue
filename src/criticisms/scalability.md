# Scalability


!!! warning "work in progress"


Can Bitcoin scale to meet global demand?

Critics will say Bitcoin cannot scale,
 that it only supports
 7 transactions per second.
And while this is true for base layer
 transactions (final international settlement),
 2nd layer solutions like the
 lightning network
 provide functionally unlimited
 and instant transactions.

However, what about creating lightning
 channels, each of which requires a
 base layer transaction.
Can all humans on earth open lightning channel?

The logic of the critics is usually to
 take whatever perceived scaling limit
 they can find and then proclaim,
 "ah hah, this is less than 8-billion,
 Bitcoin can't be money."
With this same logic,
 fiat definitely couldn't scale either,
 credit cards couldn't scale,
 not even coins could scale -- there are only
 2-billion US quarters,
"ah hah, this is less than 8-billion,
 quarters can't be money".

Truth is, under a Bitcoin standard not
 every human needs to make base layer
 transactions.
They don't need to open lightning channels.
Only entities that we can call sovereigns
 will need to do base layer transactions.

And, as we shall see, Bitcoin supports
 vastly more sovereigns than does fiat.
In our pure fiat economy, there are
 approximately ~200 different central
 banks, each representing their own
 financial sovereignty.
Base layer transactions under fiat
 happen infrequently between these
 sovereigns, typically through
 treasury bonds, where they buy and
 sell each others debt.
In practice there is only ~20 or so
 sovereign currencies that actually,
 as the rest are typically backed by
 the top fiat currencies (USD, EUR, JPY, etc).

What would this look like under a 
 Bitcoin standard, and how would
 Bitcoin actually scale to fulfill
 the global demand for money?


## In the year 2140

Full Bitcoin Standard.
Market cap of money, $300T, $14.285M BTCUSD

1 sat ~= 0.1428 USD

1 USD ~= 7 sats


TXN fee average, 1000 sats
$1,428 per txn

3000 txns per block
$4.28M block reward

$1,428 is then roughly the fee to go 
 from 2nd layer savings to sovereign individual.
In other words, to secure your savings
 outside any custodian, to provide your own
 liquidity for 2nd layer savings and payments,
 to free oneself from whichever sovereign 
 one was previously working for.
As a sovereign individual, one is free to hire
 their own team, investing in their own
 infrastructure.
They either profit, sustain, or go bankrupt
 (assets absorbed into a different sovereign).
Competition amongst sovereign individuals
 is zero sum on the base layer, but positive
 sum in local environments as economies grow
 and new sovereign individuals are created.

Fast forward... The value of the Bitcoin Standard
 increases by 7x

$100M BTCUSD
1 sat = 1 USD

$10,000 per txn, the cost of 
 becoming a sovereign individual is 7x harder.
This benefits families and multigenerational
 wealth strategies while not precluding
 individuals from joining the ranks
 of financial sovereignty.

Each block is worth $30M, network security
 is at an ATH despite zero block subsidy
 (it's no longer mining, just 
 payment processing).

157.68M transactions per year

This roughly equates to 10s of millions of
 financial sovereigns, out of billions of
 people.
Most will not be a sovereign.
Families and dynasties will be sovereign.

Let's imagine 12-billion global population,
 and only 90-million sovereigns.
This is an average population of 133 persons
 per sovereign.
Under a Pareto distribution, we can expect
 80% of the population in the top 20%
 of sovereigns, that is,
 9.6B people in 18M sovereigns,
 averaging ~533 people per sovereign.
The largest sovereigns might have thousands
 of people, maybe even tens of thousands.
But due to the nature of the game, it's
 unlikely a given sovereign would grow too
 large
 (before disintegrating into smaller sovereigns).
And people would be free to go from one
 sovereign to another; you're working
 for Bitcoin after all.
They all need workers and people,
 they're always hiring (otherwise why waste the
 money on even being a sovereign).

In any reasonable analysis,
 this is is far more scalable than the ~200 or
 so sovereign nation states
 (with ~20 carrying the real value,
 and only 7-8 that actually matter)
 acting as totalitarian
 regimes and slave labor coordinators for
 billions of people.
A Bitcoin standard is the end fiat,
 the end of a global oligarchy, 
 much like modernity was the
 end of nepotistic monarchies.

A future Bitcoin standard could 
 easily scale to millions of sovereign
 individuals and dynasties.
Where nation states are either relics
 of a strange past, or if they're
 still surviving, they're amongst the
 tens of millions of sovereigns, competing
 for wealth and human resources like
 all the others.
