# Scalability

!!! warning "work in progress"


This is a deceptively fun criticism.
It usually sounds like this,

!!! quote "Bitcoin only supports up to 7 transactions per second. Do the math, that's not enough."

And while this is true for base layer
 transactions (final international settlement),
 2nd layer solutions like the
 lightning network
 provide a highly scalable payment network
 that can scale upwards to infinity.

But the critic is not interested in second
 layer payment rails or any actual
 engineering solutions to their criticism.
The pattern of this criticism
 is quite dumb and once you see it 
 it'll be hard to unsee.
Take whatever perceived scaling limit
 that is less than the population of humans,
 and declare it as a fatal flaw in Bitcoin.

!!! quote "ah hah, this is less than 8-billion people, Bitcoin can't be money."

With this same logic,
 fiat couldn't scale,
 credit cards couldn't scale,
 not even coins could scale -- there are only
 2-billion US quarters,
"ah hah, this is less than 8-billion,
 quarters can't be money".

Rarely will you find a nuanced
 scaling criticism -- there are however,
 some interesting critiques and thought
 exercises to be found here.
For example, how would lightning
 channels scale globally?


## Scalability of Lightning Channels

Opening or closing a lightning
 channel will require a
 base layer transaction.
Can all humans on earth open 
 a lightning channel?
Can we have 8-billion lightning channels?

Truth is, under a Bitcoin standard not
 every human will need to make base layer
 transactions.
And they don't need to open lightning channels.
Only entities that we can call *sovereigns*
 will need to do base layer transactions
 and manage their own lightning channels.
A lightning channel is effectively a
 liquidity provider for payments.

We see the same pattern with fiat, except with
 fiat the sovereign has the power of seigniorage;
 they can print as much money (liquidity) as they
 desire.
Sovereign fiat currencies compete with each other,
 all trying their best to be the strongest
 fiat -- print too much and you hyperinflate,
 but print too little and you'll have no
 seigniorage money (would have to get a real job).
Under a Bitcoin standard, no one has the power
 of seigniorage.
The fixed supply of Bitcoin and the ending of
 seigniorage is the entire value proposition
 of Bitcoin.

Under a Bitcoin standard,
 sovereigns will compete,
 and they will do so
 fairly under the rules of a fixed global
 money supply.
If a sovereign lacks liquidity in their
 lightning channels (that is, they can't pay you),
 you simply go to a sovereign that can.
This is more or less how the gold standard
 functioned before it was corrupted by
 fractional reserve paper money.



## Sovereigns and Scale

Importantly, Bitcoin supports
 vastly more sovereigns than does fiat.
In today's global fiat economy, there are
 approximately ~200 different central
 banks, each representing their own
 financial sovereignty.
Base layer transactions under fiat
 happen infrequently between these
 sovereigns, typically through
 treasury bonds, where they buy and
 sell each others debt.
In practice there is only ~20 or so
 sovereign currencies with real value,
 and only 7-8 that actually matter.
Most fiat currencies are typically backed by
 those top 7-8 fiat currencies
 (USD, EUR, JPY, etc).

Under a Bitcoin standard, money
 is decoupled from state,
 and the power of seigniorage is no more.
Anyone with sufficient Bitcoin to do base
 layer transactions 
 (and could open and
 close lightning channels) would be a
 sovereign.
This would include nation states,
 corporations, family dynasties,
 and even individuals
 (see the 
 [Sovereign Individual](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sovereign_Individual)).
If this seems bizarre, consider
 that this is far more aligned
 with the history of money and civilization
 than this ~50 year experiment in
 global fiat we're currently experiencing.

But how many sovereigns could exist
 under a Bitcoin standard?
Answering this is pure speculation,
 but if we're only concerned with the
 mathematics of global scale, let's imagine
 a distant future where the very
 idea of fiat money is a footnote
 in history, an oddity of less advanced
 people who pretended governments
 could issue money.
Let us imagine a Bitcoin standard.
Let us imagine, the year 2140.



## In the year 2140

If Bitcoin has survived this long,
 it will have proven itself true.
The world will be a vastly different
 place with wonders far beyond our present
 imagination.
However, there are some things we can know
 with relative certainty.
For example, the last Satoshi
 will have been mined.
The fixed supply is fixed with zero inflation.
What we today call "mining" will instead
 be a global transaction 
 settlement layer, where sovereigns
 compete in a zero sum game for transaction
 fees.

And with some degree of confidence, we can
 predict that fiat money is gone. 
Money is decoupled from nation states,
 which, if they're still around, are
 far weaker and less influencial than
 what we see today.

And, the easiest prediction of all:
 Bitcoin will simply be known as "money".

Let us imagine a global population of
 12-billiom humans.
Living in relative peace, though
 always with the typical human dramas
 that define humanity.


Full Bitcoin Standard.
Market cap of money, $300T, $14.285M BTCUSD

1 sat ~= 0.1428 USD

1 USD ~= 7 sats


TXN fee average, 1000 sats
$1,428 per txn

3000 txns per block
$4.28M block reward

$1,428 is then roughly the fee to go 
 from 2nd layer savings to sovereign individual.
In other words, to secure your savings
 outside any custodian, to provide your own
 liquidity for 2nd layer savings and payments,
 to free oneself from whichever sovereign 
 one was previously working for.
As a sovereign individual, one is free to hire
 their own team, investing in their own
 infrastructure.
They either profit, sustain, or go bankrupt
 (assets absorbed into a different sovereign).
Competition amongst sovereign individuals
 is zero sum on the base layer, but positive
 sum in local environments as economies grow
 and new sovereign individuals are created.

Fast forward... The value of the Bitcoin Standard
 increases by 7x

$100M BTCUSD
1 sat = 1 USD

$10,000 per txn, the cost of 
 becoming a sovereign individual is 7x harder.
This benefits families and multigenerational
 wealth strategies while not precluding
 individuals from joining the ranks
 of financial sovereignty.

Each block is worth $30M, network security
 is at an ATH despite zero block subsidy
 (it's no longer mining, just 
 payment processing).

157.68M transactions per year

This roughly equates to 10s of millions of
 financial sovereigns, out of billions of
 people.
Most will not be a sovereign.
Families and dynasties will be sovereign.

Let's imagine 12-billion global population,
 and only 90-million sovereigns.
This is an average population of 133 persons
 per sovereign.
Under a Pareto distribution, we can expect
 80% of the population in the top 20%
 of sovereigns, that is,
 9.6B people in 18M sovereigns,
 averaging ~533 people per sovereign.
The largest sovereigns might have thousands
 of people, maybe even tens of thousands.
But due to the nature of the game, it's
 unlikely a given sovereign would grow too
 large
 (before disintegrating into smaller sovereigns).
And people would be free to go from one
 sovereign to another; you're working
 for Bitcoin after all.
They all need workers and people,
 they're always hiring (otherwise why waste the
 money on even being a sovereign).

In any reasonable analysis,
 this is is far more scalable than the ~200 or
 so sovereign nation states
 (with ~20 carrying the real value,
 and only 7-8 that actually matter)
 acting as totalitarian
 regimes and slave labor coordinators for
 billions of people.
A Bitcoin standard is the end fiat,
 the end of a global oligarchy, 
 much like modernity was the
 end of nepotistic monarchies.

A future Bitcoin standard could 
 easily scale to millions of sovereign
 individuals and dynasties.
Where nation states are either relics
 of a strange past, or if they're
 still surviving, they're amongst the
 tens of millions of sovereigns, competing
 for wealth and human resources like
 all the others.
