# Criticisms

There is a lot of criticism of Bitcoin,
 and yet throughout all the noise, 
 it's nearly impossible 
 to find a critic that understands
 Bitcoin, let alone demonstrates
 that understanding.

!!! warning "*The biggest risk to Bitcoin is its lack of competent crÃ­tics.*"

This suggests that Bitcoin is actually *true*, and
 that the critics are plainly stupid,
 lazy, and intellectually dishonest. However,
 this also presents a significant weakness of
 Bitcoin. Lack of competent criticism for 
 something as important as money, and the 
 separation of money and state, poses a serious
 risk. E.g., if you discovered that Bitcoin is 
 going to bring about a catastrophe, 
 how would you stop it?
 Could you stop it?
 
And interestingly, for Bitcoin to succeed
 it needs to be unstoppable. The powers
 against it are great. So the question, 

> *"is Bitcoin true?"*

This question can better be asked,

> *is Bitcoin 
 sufficiently true that its
 dominance is inevitable?*

We will explore the
 common criticisms as well as the
 more reasonable and valid criticisms.
