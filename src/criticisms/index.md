# Criticisms

There is a lot of criticism of Bitcoin,
 a lot,
 especially from journalists and so-called experts,
 and yet despite the constant criticism, 
 it's nearly impossible 
 to find critics that understand
 Bitcoin, let alone demonstrates
 that understanding.
In practice if these critics were right,
 Bitcoin should have been dead years ago.
And yet despite this, the quality of the criticisms
 haven't improved as Bitcoin has succeeded.
The criticism has become incessant noise with very little signal.



!!! warning "*The biggest risk to Bitcoin is its lack of competent crÃ­tics.*"

This suggests
 that the critics are stupid,
 lazy, and intellectually dishonest
 (being so unabashedly uninterested in the pursuit of truth). 
In fact, most of the media today seems to function as
 propaganda defending the status quo, and
 accepting without question the dictates of power.

However,
 this also presents a significant weakness of
 Bitcoin. Lack of competent criticism 
 poses a serious risk. 
Especially for something as important as money
 and the separation of money and state.

E.g., if the critics were right
 and Bitcoin proves to be dangerous,
 how would you stop it?
 Could you stop it?
 
And interestingly, for Bitcoin to succeed
 it needs to be unstoppable. The powers
 against it are great. So the question, 

> *"is Bitcoin true?"*

This question can better be asked,

> *is Bitcoin 
 sufficiently true that its
 dominance is inevitable?*

We will steel-man the
 common criticisms as well as explore
 reasonable and valid criticisms.
And in all cases we will tackle the strongest
 version of these criticisms,
 avoiding the typical inept stupidity
 found in most Bitcoin critics.
