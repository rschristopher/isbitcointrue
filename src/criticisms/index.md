# Criticisms

There is a lot of criticism of Bitcoin,
 a lot,
 especially from media and so-called experts,
 and yet despite the constant criticism, 
 it's nearly impossible 
 to find critics that understand
 Bitcoin, let alone demonstrates
 that understanding.
In practice if these critics were right,
 Bitcoin should have been dead years ago.
And yet the quality of the criticisms haven't
 seemed to improve.
It is noise that seems to just get louder.



!!! warning "*The biggest risk to Bitcoin is its lack of competent crÃ­tics.*"

This suggests that Bitcoin is actually *true*,
 and that the critics are plainly stupid,
 lazy, and intellectually dishonest. 
Most are propagandists defending the status quo,
 accepting without question the dictates of power.

However,
 this also presents a significant weakness of
 Bitcoin. Lack of competent criticism for 
 something as important as money, and the 
 separation of money and state, poses a serious
 risk. 

E.g., if you discovered that Bitcoin is 
 going to bring about a catastrophe, 
 how would you stop it?
 Could you stop it?
 
And interestingly, for Bitcoin to succeed
 it needs to be unstoppable. The powers
 against it are great. So the question, 

> *"is Bitcoin true?"*

This question can better be asked,

> *is Bitcoin 
 sufficiently true that its
 dominance is inevitable?*

We will steel-man the
 common criticisms as well as explore
 reasonable and valid criticisms.
And in all cases we will tackle the strongest
 version of these criticisms,
 avoiding the typical inept stupidity
 found in most Bitcoin critics.
