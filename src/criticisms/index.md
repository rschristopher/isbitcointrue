# Criticisms

*The biggest risk to Bitcoin is its lack of
 competent crÃ­tics.*

There is no end of criticism to Bitcoin, and
 yet throughout all the noise, it's nearly
 impossible to find a criticism that understands
 Bitcoin, let alone demonstrate that understanding
 in the criticism.

This can suggest that Bitcoin is *true*, and
 that the critics are plainly stupid,
 lazy, and intellectually dishonest. However,
 this also presents a significant weakness of
 Bitcoin. Lack of competent criticism for 
 something as important as money, and the 
 separation of money and state, poses a serious
 risk. For if you discovered that Bitcoin is 
 going to bring about a catastrophy, 
 how would you even stop it?
 Could you stop it?
 
And interestingly, for Bitcoin to succeed
 it needs to be unstoppable. The powers
 against it are great. So the question 

> *"is Bitcoin true?"*

Can be re-articulated as, *is Bitcoin 
 sufficiently true that its eventual
 dominance is inevitable?*
