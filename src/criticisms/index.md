# Criticisms

The biggest risk to Bitcoin is its lack of
 competent cr√≠tics.
 There is no end of criticism to Bitcoin, and
 yet throughout all the noise, it's nearly
 impossible to find a criticism that understands
 Bitcoin and can demonstrate that understanding
 in their criticism.

This can suggest that Bitcoin is *true*, and
 that the critics are plainly stupid,
 lazy, and intellectually dishonest. However,
 this also presents a significant weakness of
 Bitcoin. Lack of competent criticism for 
 something as important as money, and the 
 separation of money and state, poses a serious
 risk. For if I discovered that Bitcoin is going
 to bring about the end of the world, how would
 you stop it?
