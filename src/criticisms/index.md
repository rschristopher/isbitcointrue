# Criticisms

There is a lot of criticism of Bitcoin --
 *a lot*
 -- especially from journalists and so-called 
 experts,
 and yet despite the constant criticism, 
 it's nearly impossible 
 to find critics that understand
 Bitcoin, let alone demonstrate
 their understanding.

In practice, if the critics were right,
 Bitcoin should have been dead years ago.
In fact, it has been declared
 dead,
 many
 many
 times.
And yet despite this, the quality of the criticism
 hasn't improved even as Bitcoin has succeeded.
The criticism has become incessant
 noise with very little signal.

!!! info "*There is no informed criticism. The more one learns about Bitcoin, the more one supports Bitcoin.*"


This of course suggests
 that the critics are ill-informed,
 lazy, and intellectually dishonest
 (being so unabashedly uninterested
 in the pursuit of truth). 
It would even suggest that most of the media functions as
 propaganda defending the status quo, and
 accepting without question the dictates of power.

However,
 this also presents a significant weakness of
 Bitcoin. 
Lack of competent criticism 
 poses a serious risk,
 especially for something as important as money,
 including the 
 separation of money and state.

!!! warning "*The biggest risk to Bitcoin is its lack of competent crÃ­tics.*"

E.g., if the critics were right
 and Bitcoin proves to be dangerous,
 how would you stop it?
 Could you stop it?
 
And interestingly, for Bitcoin to succeed
 it needs to be unstoppable. The powers
 against it are great. So the question, 

> *"is Bitcoin true?"*

This question can better be asked,

> *is Bitcoin 
 sufficiently true that its
 dominance is inevitable?*

We will steel-man the
 common criticisms as well as explore
 reasonable and valid criticisms of Bitcoin.
And in all cases we will tackle the strongest
 version of each criticisms,
 avoiding the typical inept stupidity
 found in most Bitcoin critics.
