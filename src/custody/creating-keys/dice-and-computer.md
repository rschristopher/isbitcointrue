# Dice and Computer

...

We can use our airgapped computer 
 to convert dice rolls
 into a seed phrase. 
This will give us the verified entropy
 of dice rolls, and when done correctly
 can be more secure than dice and paper.

This technique is also applicable to other
 methods of creating 256-bits of entropy,
 from I-Ching Hexagrams to Tarot cards.
 All that is required is a list of unique
 characters to represent the set.
