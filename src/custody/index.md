# Custody

To hold or *custody* Bitcoin means 
 securing the private keys that would be needed
 to spend your Bitcoin.

Unlike physical custody of assets, 
 custody of Bitcoin 
 means to store a key or seed phrase,
 and to store it in such a way that no one else
 would be able to know it.

For example, consider the following seed phrase,

!!! info "Example Seed Phrase"

    ```
    holiday crew machine fatigue welcome start axis cancel field slim rifle hero
    ```

This is a valid seed phrase, 
 and it can be used to generate keys
 as well as invoice addresses to custody Bitcoin.

Because this seed phrase has been revealed,
 anyone can generate private keys from this seed.
 But what if you had to secure this seed phrase?

In other words, how would you secure this phrase 
 such that it meets the following,

1. The seed phrase is accessible only to yourself
 and others you trust (family members and the like), and
1. No one else could ever know the seed phrase

Knowing how to fulfil the above 
 is at the heart of how to custody Bitcoin.

## Self Custody

Self Custody means you personally 
 secure your seed phrase and manage your keys.
 This not only is the recommended approach but
 is the **only** way to properly secure your
 Bitcoin.

## The Problem with Institutional Custody

If you trust an institution to custody your Bitcoin,
 then it's not your Bitcoin, it's their Bitcoin.
 And no matter how secure their custody system,
 it will never be as secure or as easy as Self Custody.

!!! danger "Not your Bitcoin"
    
    An institution with "your" Bitcoin can
    use this Bitcoin as collateral for a loan.
    If they're particularly clever they can buy
    more Bitcoin with that loan, and devise
    fractional reserve schemes. If they go
    bankrupt do you get "your" Bitcoin back?
    
    An institution with "your" Bitcoin can 
    lock you out of your account. The governments
    in whichever countries they reside can lock
    you out or seize your funds. Perhaps your name
    was too similar to someone on a sanctions list,
    or perhaps your government is in a dispute
    with another government and they 
    suspend your account.

    A hacker who learned your mother's maiden name
    may be able to withdraw "your" Bitcoin. 
    Perhaps one of the many data breaches resulted
    in your personal information leaking out,
    putting "your" Bitcoin at risk.






And by this very nature of Bitcoin, 
 money can be transferred easily across the world.



Why self-custody?

> So that you can be a sovereign of your own savings.


Why be a Sovereign of your own Savings?

> Why not? Why be beholden to a system that loses your money?
> If you lose your Bitcoin, it's your fault -- there were things you could have done better.
> If the bank loses your money, or accidentally leaks your identity in a data breach resulting in your accounts being liquidated, there's nothing you could have done (other than not use the bank).


!!! question "Why would I want to be a bank?"
    
    Because the banks aren't competent. 
    And Bitcoin allows superior custody services 
    that no bank or institution will be able 
    to match.

!!! question "It's as easy as changing a light-bulb?"
    
    Imagine asking a person in the 
    middle ages to change a light bulb. 
    They'd be confused and 
    without explicit instructions
    they would probably
    electrocute themselves.
    
    Bitcoin is no different. 
    Future generations will laugh at you
    for being so hopeless ignorant of
    what will seem obvious and intuitive to them.



Is it really so hard?

> No, it's exactly as hard as learning about the Internet in the 1990s.
> It's new, it's different, and it confuses those who haven't realized the problems with money and finance.


I heard it requires 'persistent competence', is that true?

> Yes, and so does trusting traditional banking.
> Securing your assets in the traditional system requires complex ever-changning passwords, multi-factor authentication, and a Rube-goldberg machine of security-theater where telling a call-center operator in the Philipines what your mother's maiden name is, somehow constitutes security.
> The risk of losing your funds in traditional banking is far higher than any reasonable self-custody solution.
