# Custody

To hold or custody Bitcoin means 
 securing the private keys that would be needed
 to spend your Bitcoin.

Unlike physical custody, custody of Bitcoin 
 means to store a key or seed phrase,
 and to store it in such a way that no one 
 would be able to read it.

!!! example "example"
    If I see a video of gold bullion in a vault,
    I cannot take that gold just by looking at it.
    Yet with Bitcoin, a single photo of a
     seed phrase is all that's needed to take 
     control of that Bitcoin.

And by this very nature of Bitcoin, 
 money can be transferred easily across the world.



Why self-custody?

> So that you can be a sovereign of your own savings.


Why be a Sovereign of your own Savings?

> Why not? Why be beholden to a system that loses your money?
> If you lose your Bitcoin, it's your fault -- there were things you could have done better.
> If the bank loses your money, or accidentally leaks your identity in a data breach resulting in your accounts being liquidated, there's nothing you could have done (other than not use the bank).


Why would I want to be a bank?

> Because the banks aren't competent. And Bitcoin allows superior custody services that no bank or institution will be able to match.
> Proper self-custody is no more complicated than changing a light-bulb. 

> But imagine asking a person in the middle ages to change a light bulb. They'd be confused and possibly would electrocute themselves.
> Bitcoin is no different. Future generations will laugh at you for being so hopeless ignorant of what will seem obvious and intuitive to them.



Is it really so hard?

> No, it's exactly as hard as learning about the Internet in the 1990s.
> It's new, it's different, and it confuses those who haven't realized the problems with money and finance.


I heard it requires 'persistent competence', is that true?

> Yes, and so does trusting traditional banking.
> Securing your assets in the traditional system requires complex ever-changning passwords, multi-factor authentication, and a Rube-goldberg machine of security-theater where telling a call-center operator in the Philipines what your mother's maiden name is, somehow constitutes security.
> The risk of losing your funds in traditional banking is far higher than any reasonable self-custody solution.
