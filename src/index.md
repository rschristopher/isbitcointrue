# Is Bitcoin True?

*by* ***R.S. Christopher***


This is a collection of essays
 and information all centered around
 a single question.
It is a question most worth pursuing.
*Is Bitcoin True?*

In other words, we aim to understand:
 is Bitcoin money?
Is the fixed supply of Bitcoin truly fixed?
Will this solve the problems
 of seigniorage and fiat currency?

We will not be satisfied
 with shallow
 criticisms
 and hype.
We want to know whether
 there is truth to Bitcoin.
And we will go as deep as
 necessary to discover this
 truth.



## Who is R.S. Christopher?

*Reprobus Saint Christopher*, the dog-headed
 saint of travelers and Bitcoiners.
While revisionists like to say St. Christopher 
 was an ordinary man, 
 arrogantly proclaiming that
 *"dog-headed men"* never
 actually existed
 and that it was all just a
 translation
 error 
 or worse, a myth --
no, St. Christopher actually was
 a dog-headed giant;
a monster from beyond the fringes,
 haunting the marginalia of
 our ancient world.
And yet, in the pursuit of power,
 Reprobus instead found salvation.

And now St. Christopher helps travelers and
 Bitcoiners find their way.

## Who are you, really?

No one important, just a pseudonym.
And ultimately 
 it doesn't
 really matter who I am -- what
 matters is whether the claims
 about Bitcoin are true, or not.

Perhaps more importantly,
 who are *you*?
Are you a seeker of truth?
Are you willing to challenge
 preconceived notions and deeply
 held beliefs?
Is *truth* important to you?

Some of the arguments put forth
 in these essays 
 may challenge the status quo
 to which you cling.
It might be uncomfortable.
So again I ask,
 is truth really important to you?
