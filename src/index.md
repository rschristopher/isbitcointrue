# Is Bitcoin True?

*by* ***R.S. Christopher***


This is a collection of essays
 and information all centered around
 a single question:
*Is Bitcoin True?*
In other words, we aim to understand:
 is Bitcoin money?
Is the fixed supply truly fixed?
Will this solve the problems
 of seigniorage and fiat currency?

We will not be satisfied
 with shallow
 criticisms
 and hype.
We want to know whether
 there is truth to Bitcoin.
And we will go as deep as
 needed to discover this
 truth.


## Who are you?

No one important, and ultimately 
 it doesn't
 really matter who I am -- what
 matters is whether the claims
 about Bitcoin are true, or not.


## Who is R.S. Christopher?

*Reprobus Saint Christopher*, the dog-headed
 saint of travelers and Bitcoiners.
While revisionists like to say I am
 an ordinary man, 
 arrogantly proclaiming
 dog-headed creatures don't
 actually exist
 and that it was all just a
 translation
 error 
 or a myth --
no, *I am* a dog-headed giant;
a monster from beyond the fringes,
 haunting the marginalia of your world.
And yet, in my pursuit of power,
 I found salvation.

And now I help travelers and
 Bitcoiners find their way.
