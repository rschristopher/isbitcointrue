Under a Bitcoin Standard,
 commerce is the exchange of Bitcoin
 for goods and services, from 
 payments over the Lightning network, to
 final international settlement on the base layer.
And like [saving](../saving/)
 in Bitcoin, commerce starts simple
 and grows more and more powerful.
Not only can one be a sovereign of their
 own savings, they can be a true
 financial sovereign
 (not by fiat, but simply by opting in
 to sound money, getting paid in Bitcoin,
 and buying goods and services in Bitcoin).

Below is an overview of the levels, guiding
 one from hobbyist to full financial
 sovereign.


## Sovereignty Levels

* [Level 1: Getting Started](sovereignty/level-1) -- 
 buying and selling goods
 and services using Bitcoin
* [Level 2: Payment Service](sovereignty/level-2) --
 use a hosted payment system
 for your business or hobby
* [Level 3: Self Hosted](sovereignty/level-3) --
 use a self hosted payment system
 integrated into self custody
* [Level 4: Full Node](sovereignty/level-4) --
 run a dedicated full node (and lightning node)
* [Level 5: Private Channels](sovereignty/level-5) --
 establish private lightning channels
 with local partners
* [Level 6: Localism](sovereignty/level-6) --
 establish local-area off-grid networks

Before diving in and learning to become a
 financial sovereign, you may want to first
 [understand the terms](understand-the-terms.md).
