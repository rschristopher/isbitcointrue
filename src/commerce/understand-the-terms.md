# Understand the Terms

While saving in Bitcoin involves
 new concepts
 that don't otherwise exist in
 traditional economic models
 (such as a cryptographic ledger or UTXO sets),
 Bitcoin commerce 
 is well aligned with
 traditional economic models.
The goal is simply to make
 or receive payments.
For businesses it means
 selling goods and serves,
 getting paid in Bitcoin.
For customers it means
 paying for goods and services,
 as easily as you would
 pay in cash.

If you're coming from a fiat mindset,
 that is, commerce within fiat currency,
 Bitcoin commerce might seem odd at first,
 but you'll
 find it similar
 to *traditional* (pre fiat)
 business models.
This is because most of those traditional
 business models developed under a gold
 standard (a sound money standard).

In practice, you may find commerce
 under a Bitcoin standard to be
 intuitive and simple, with less of the complex
 financialization one finds in modern fiat.
There are however some new concepts,
 in particular new technical concepts
 that are worth understanding.
We will describe and help demystify these
 technical concepts, especially those
 necessary for understanding commerce
 in Bitcoin.
