# Understand the Terms

While saving in Bitcoin involves
 new concepts
 that don't otherwise exist in
 traditional economic models
 (such as a cryptographic ledger or UTXO sets),
 Bitcoin commerce 
 is well aligned with
 traditional economics.
The goal is simply to make
 and receive payments.
For businesses it means
 selling goods and services --
 getting paid in Bitcoin.
For customers it means
 paying for goods and services --
 as easily as you would
 pay in cash.

If you're coming from a fiat mindset,
 that is, commerce within fiat currency,
 Bitcoin commerce might seem odd at first,
 but you'll
 find it similar
 to *traditional* (pre-fiat)
 business models.
This is because most of those traditional
 business models developed under a gold
 standard (a sound money standard).

As a result, you may find commerce
 under a Bitcoin standard to be
 intuitive and simple,
 almost naive,
 with none of the complex
 financialization one finds in modern fiat.
There are however some new concepts,
 in particular new technical concepts
 that are worth understanding.
We will describe and help demystify these
 new concepts, especially those
 necessary for understanding commerce
 in Bitcoin.










## Lightning Network

Lightning is a Bitcoin payment network.
It allows virtually unlimited scaling
 of Bitcoin payments;
 and is built on top of the
 Bitcoin network as a
 second-layer network.
In other words, the base-layer
 network has no visibility
 into lightning payments,
 but only provides
 final settlement of
 lightning channels.

In effect, Lightning
 is a network of channels
 between peer-to-peer
 Bitcoin nodes.
Each channel
 provides liquidity
 between two nodes;
 a balance on each side.
Lightning routes payments
 through the channels,
 allowing users anywhere
 in the network to send
 and receive Bitcoin 
 anywhere else on the
 network
 (provided there is sufficient
 liquidity in the channels).
