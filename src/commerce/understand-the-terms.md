# Understand the Terms

While saving in Bitcoin involves
 new concepts
 that don't otherwise exist in
 traditional economic models
 (such as a cryptographic ledger),
 Bitcoin commerce 
 is well aligned with these
 traditional models.
The goal is simply to make
 or receive payments;
 to buy and sell.
For businesses it means
 selling goods and serves,
 getting paid in Bitcoin.
For consumers it means
 paying for goods and services,
 as easily as you would
 pay in cash.
