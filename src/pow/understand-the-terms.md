# Understand the Terms

*Mining* is perhaps the most confusing
 metaphor within Bitcoin.
It is perhaps better understood as 
 a transaction processor, allowing
 for *final international settlement*,
 in addition to ensuring that the
 supply schedule stays on its predetermined
 course.
Unfortunately, there's no word to adequately
 describe all that, hence the circumlocutions
 necessary to describe what 
 Bitcoin "mining" really is.

For these reasons, we've called this section
 *Proof of Work*.
Because for better or worse, the entirety
 of Bitcoin mining, international settlement
 processing, whatever you want to call it --
 all rests on top of what is known as a
 *proof of work* consensus mechanism.
