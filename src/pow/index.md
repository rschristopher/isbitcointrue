 overview of how Bitcoin mining works
* [Level 2: Mining Pools](level-2) --
 setup a miner and point to a mining pool
* [Level 3: Solo Mining](level-3) --
 setup a full node and stratum server
* [Level 4: Solo Mining Farm](level-4) --
 run a farm of Bitcoin miners
* [Level 5: Block Broadcasting](level-5) --
 run a well-peered network of nodes to minimize the risk of orphaned blocks
* [Level 6: Stratum Selector](level-6) --
 dynamically choose different stratum servers (pools) based on luck measure
* [Level 7: Off-grid Mining](level-7) --
 relocate miners to off-grid energy sources
