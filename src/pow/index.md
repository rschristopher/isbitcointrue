# Proof of Work

Bitcoin transactions are processed through
 a highly competitive system of
 *proof of work* hashing, *aka* mining.
This is also, coincidentally, how Bitcoin
 is issued and how issuance stays on
 a fixed supply schedule -- which is how the
 total supply will remain fixed, forever.

While most people will be
 [saving](../saving/)
 and
 [transacting](../commerce) in Bitcoin,
 very few will be involved
 in mining, and far fewer will be successful.
Ultimately, the mechanism that guarantees
 final international settlement is a
 highly competitive (and adversarial)
 zero sum game.

For those foolish enough to play this game
 -- *and for some it's more a matter of fate than
 want* --
 the only way to be successful is a
 combination of competence, luck, and
 by far the most important: a ridiculous 
 work ethic.

> “Always poor is he who works with an indolent hand, but the hand of the diligent brings wealth” (Proverbs 10:4)

If you're looking for passive income or an exciting investment opportunity,
 Bitcoin mining is most certainly not
 for you.
However, if honest hard work is just your kind of game, well then -- welcome to the
 [arena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_in_a_Republic), where you'll find the "rough work of a work day world."


## Sovereignty Levels

* [Level 1: Getting Started](sovereignty/level-1) -- Start hashing!
* [Level 2: Mining Pools](sovereignty/level-2) -- Setup a dedicated Bitcoin miner and point to a mining pool
* [Level 3: Mining Farm](sovereignty/level-3) -- Run a farm of dedicated Bitcoin miners
* [Level 4: Solo Mining](sovereignty/level-4) -- Run a full node and a stratum server
* [Level 5: Block Broadcasting](sovereignty/level-5) -- Run a well-peered network of nodes
* [Level 6: Off-grid Mining](sovereignty/level-6) -- Relocate miners to off-grid energy sources

Before diving in and daring to test your fate
 at Bitcoin mining, you may want to first
 [understand the terms](understand-the-terms.md).
