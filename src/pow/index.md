# Proof of Work

Bitcoin transactions are processed through
 a highly competitive system of
 *proof of work* hashing, *aka* mining.
This is also, coincidentally, how Bitcoin
 is issued and how issuance stays on
 a fixed supply schedule, and how the
 total supply is (and always will remain) fixed.

While most people will be
 [saving](../saving/)
 and
 [transacting](../commerce) in Bitcoin,
 very few will be involved
 in mining, and far fewer will be successful.
Ultimately, the mechanism that guarantees
 final international settlement is a
 highly competitive (and adversarial)
 zero sum game.

For those foolish enough to play this game
 -- *and for some it's more a matter of fate than
 want* --
 the only way to be successful is a
 combination of competence, luck, and
 by far the most important: a ridiculous 
 work ethic.

If you're afraid to die on a treadmill,
 Bitcoin mining is most certainly not
 for you.
However, if this sounds like
 just your kind of game,
 well then -- welcome to the

## Sovereignty Levels

* [Level 1: Getting Started](sovereignty/level-1) -- 
 overview of how Bitcoin mining works
* [Level 2: Mining Pools](sovereignty/level-2) --
 setup a miner and point to a mining pool
* [Level 3: Solo Mining](sovereignty/level-3) --
 setup a full node and stratum server
* [Level 4: Mining Farm](sovereignty/level-4) --
 run a farm of Bitcoin miners
* [Level 5: Block Broadcasting](sovereignty/level-5) --
 run a well-peered network of nodes
* [Level 6: Stratum Selector](sovereignty/level-6) --
 dynamically choose different stratum servers
* [Level 7: Off-grid Mining](sovereignty/level-7) --
 relocate miners to off-grid energy sources

Before diving in and daring to test your fate
 at Bitcoin mining, you may want to first
