# Sovereignty


!!! warning "work in progress"


<!--

Lord Jesus Christ
Son of the living God
Have mercy on me, a sinner


In the year 2525
If man is still alive...

Is there still mining pools?

~50 million sovereigns
12 billion subjects

The subjects work and save and spend,
 working with one sovereign or another.
If their sovereign is strong, they can
 save and retire and live a comfortable
 life.
Otherwise, they either find a better sovereign,
 or become a sovereign.
No one is denied the opportunity, except by
 act by God.

There is no more block subsidy.
Miners are on-chain settlement exchanges,
 turning lightning wallets into sovereign
 wealth allocations, final international
 settlement.
Miners, hy necessity, are sovereign.
Do you need a pool?
Only if your time preference is small.
Or, if the long tail of hashrate can compete.
But does it need to? It'd be a game only
 available to existing sovereigns.
Do existing sovereigns need a pool?
No.
Sovereigns compete, and if they pool, they
 are better off merging, creating a
 sovereign dynasty that hashes with their
 combined hashrate.

The only reason to pool is to get paid
 earlier than your hashrate would
 reasonably allow.
What kind of sovereign needs money that
 quickly, and is still a sovereign.
A pool is a sign of a weak sovereign.

Hashing is a game amongst sovereigns,
 making or breaking the sovereign while
 subjects quietly raise to their own sovereignty.
The smart money avoids it.
Only the strong survive in hashing.
Pools are a farce, and can only sustain
 temporarily under fiat.
The real game is and will always be
 solo mining.
