# Execution

In traditional markets, *execution* refers 
 to completing buy or sell orders, typically
 for securities or foreign currency exchange.

In practice, *execution* is merely the 
 completion of a trade, 
 the movement of goods from one party to another.

To buy or sell Bitcoin using fiat is an execution.
 To use Bitcoin as a *medium of exchange*, that is,
 exchanging goods for Bitcoin, is execution.
 This is the movement of Bitcoin, from 
 payments over the Lightning network, to
 final settlement on the base layer.
